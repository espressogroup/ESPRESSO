4	Catheterization laboratory events and hospital outcome with direct angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction To assess the safety of direct infarct angioplasty without antecedent thrombolytic therapy, catheterization laboratory and hospital events were assessed in consecutively treated patients with infarctions involving the left anterior descending (n = 100 patients), right (n = 100), and circumflex (n = 50) coronary arteries. The groups of patients were similar for age (left anterior descending coronary artery, 59 years; right coronary artery, 58 years; circumflex coronary artery, 62 years), patients with multivessel disease (left anterior descending coronary artery, 55%; right coronary artery, 55%; circumflex coronary artery, 64%), and patients with initial grade 0/1 antegrade flow (left anterior descending coronary artery, 79%; right coronary artery, 84%; circumflex coronary artery, 90%). Cardiogenic shock was present in eight patients with infarction of the left anterior descending coronary artery, four with infarction of the right coronary artery, and four with infarction of the circumflex coronary artery. Major catheterization laboratory events (cardioversion, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, dopamine or intra-aortic balloon pump support for hypotension, and urgent surgery) occurred in 10 patients with infarction of the left anterior descending coronary artery, eight with infarction of the right coronary artery, and four with infarction of the circumflex coronary artery (16 of 16 shock and six of 234 nonshock patients, p less than 0.001). There was one in-laboratory death (shock patient with infarction of the left anterior descending coronary artery). 
5	Renal abscess in children. Three cases of renal abscesses in children are described to illustrate the variable presenting features. An additional 23 pediatric cases, reported over the past ten years, were reviewed for clinical features and therapy. Fever, loin pain, and leukocytosis were common presenting features, but less than half of all abscesses were associated with either an abnormal urinalysis or a positive urine culture. The presenting features were sometimes confused with appendicitis, peritonitis, or a Wilms tumor. An organism was identified in 17 cases--Escherichia coli in 9 children and Staphylococcus aureus in 8 children. The majority of E. coli infections occurred in girls and the majority of S. aureus infections occurred in boys. Reflux was documented in 5 patients, and 2 children had a possible extrarenal source of infection. Antibiotics alone produced a cure in 10 children (38%), but 16 children (62%) required a surgical procedure. 
2	Hyperplastic polyps seen at sigmoidoscopy are markers for additional adenomas seen at colonoscopy. Asymptomatic individuals undergoing screening flexible sigmoidoscopy were prospectively studied. Polyps were found in 185 subjects. The endoscopist recorded an opinion on the polyps' histology based on endoscopic appearance. No polyps were removed at sigmoidoscopy. All subjects with rectosigmoid polyps then underwent colonoscopy and polypectomy. Of them, 99 subjects (54%) had at least one rectosigmoid adenoma, 69 (37%) had only hyperplastic polyps, and 17 (9%) had other findings. The endoscopists' opinion of the histopathology of polyps at sigmoidoscopy was correct for 61% of the lesions. Of subjects with adenomatous rectosigmoid polyps, 29% had additional adenomas at more proximal sites. Proximal adenomas were found in 28% of patients with hyperplastic rectosigmoid polyps. Patients with rectosigmoid hyperplastic polyps had the same risk for additional proximal adenomas as patients with rectosigmoid adenomatous polyps. 
5	Subclavian artery to innominate vein fistula after insertion of a hemodialysis catheter. Insertion of hemodialysis catheters for temporary use is now preferentially performed by percutaneous infraclavicular subclavian vein catheterization. This method involves passage of a stiff dilator and a peel-away sheath over a guide wire, and is usually carried out without fluoroscopy. For the most part this has proved to be a valuable and safe approach. However, a small incidence of major complications occurs, which needs to be emphasized. Sixteen cases of arteriovenous fistulas between the subclavian artery or its branches and the subclavian vein have been reported so far in the literature. To date only one case of subclavian artery to innominate vein fistula has been reported. We report the second case with this complication and suggest possible preventive measures. 
4	Effect of local inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid uptake in the dorsomedial hypothalamus on extracellular levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid and on stress-induced tachycardia: a study using microdialysis. Previous studies involving local microinjection of drugs that interfere with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition have led to the suggestion that endogenous GABA suppresses the activity of a sympatho-excitatory mechanism in the dorsomedial hypothalamus in rats. In this study, microdialysis was used to assess and to alter pharmacologically extracellular-levels of GABA within this region while simultaneously monitoring heart rate and blood pressure. In anesthetized rats, local microdialysis for 15 min with 2.5, 10 and 40 mM nipecotic acid, an inhibitor of GABA uptake, caused concentration-related increases in GABA and taurine in the extracellular space, but no significant change in heart rate or arterial pressure. Similar perfusion with 37.5, 75 and 150 mM KCl caused concentration-related increases in GABA as well as aspartate, glutamate, taurine, glycine and alanine. Only modest, variable increases in heart rate and no effect on arterial pressure were observed during the perfusions with high potassium. In conscious rats, unilateral microdialysis of the dorsomedial hypothalamus with 0.5 mM nipecotic acid for 2 to 2.5 hr before stress coupled with contralateral microinjection of muscimol (88 pmol/250 nl) 5 min before stress significantly reduced air stress-induced tachycardia; this reduction in tachycardia was associated with markedly elevated levels of GABA in dialysates collected from the dorsomedial hypothalamus. Neither treatment alone significantly influenced stress-induced increases in heart rate, although perfusion with nipecotic acid alone evoked similar elevations in extracellular GABA. These results suggest that extracellular levels of endogenous GABA in the dorsomedial hypothalamus may regulate the cardiovascular response to stress. 
1	Infection during chronic epidural catheterization: diagnosis and treatment. A potentially serious complication of long-term epidural catheterization in cancer patients is infection. The early signs of infection were studied in 350 patients in whom long-term epidural catheters were inserted. Three areas of the catheter track were found to be involved; exit site and superficial catheter track infection, and epidural space infection. The authors identified the early signs of infection in each area and the progress of the infection from the deep track to include the epidural space in four of these patients. All 19 patients who developed deep track or epidural infections were successfully treated with antibiotics and catheter removal. None of the patients required surgery for spinal cord decompression. Catheters were replaced in 15 of the 19 treated patients who requested them after treatment with no recurrent infections. It was concluded that use of long-term epidural catheterization is associated with a definable epidural infection rate. The use of epidural opioid analgesia is an effective and safe means of obtaining pain relief for terminally ill patients when patients are monitored for possible infection and receive prompt treatment when the diagnosis is established. 
5	Mediastinal tracheostomy using a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap after resection of carcinoma of the esophagus involving the proximal part of the trachea. An operative procedure of mediastinal tracheostomy using a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is presented. In this procedure, the terminal portion of the trachea penetrates through the center of a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap and the tracheal wall is completely wrapped with the muscular portion of the flap. Between 1981 and 1988, eight patients with carcinoma in the cervicothoracic segment of the esophagus underwent mediastinal tracheostomy after laryngoesophagectomy and extended resection of the proximal part of the trachea through sternal manubrectomy, because of invasion into the trachea. In five of eight patients, a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap was used to construct a tracheal stoma. A skin flap only, or both a skin flap and a muscle flap, was used in the other three. In four of eight patients, tracheal necrosis occurred, and rupture of the brachiocephalic artery occurred in one patient when the tracheal stoma had been constructed using both a skin flap and a muscle flap. However, neither skin breakdown nor bleeding from the major vessels occurred when using the myocutaneous flap. Therefore, it is concluded that the construction of the tracheal stoma using a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is recommended for mediastinal tracheostomy after laryngoesophagectomy with extended resection of the proximal part of the trachea. 
5	Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion of the extremity. Report of a case and review of the literature. Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion is an idiopathic fibroinflammatory process of the head and neck region. Although benign histopathologically, it is invasive, destructive, and locally recurrent, leading to uncertainty regarding its proper management; as the disease is rare, determining optimal treatment is difficult, given the anecdotal nature of reports. We report the first case of a tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion occurring outside the head and neck region. Our patient was treated with corticosteroids and had a favorable response, supporting this approach as initial treatment. Immunohistochemical studies performed on a pretreatment specimen were consistent with a secondary inflammatory component because no monoclonal nor aberrant phenotypes were detected. The tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion appears to be indistinguishable from the other known idiopathic fibroinflammatory processes; patients presenting with any one of these should be evaluated for the others. 
3	Multiple representations contribute to body knowledge processing. Evidence from a case of autotopagnosia. Body schema disturbances were studied in a 62-yr-old woman with Alzheimer's disease. She was severely impaired in verbal and nonverbal tasks requiring her to localize body parts (on her own body, the examiner's body or a doll's body) even though she correctly named the same parts when pointed at by the examiner. Pointing responses were misdirected mainly to parts contiguous with the target area and, to a lesser extent, to functionally equivalent body parts. We also found that the patient was able to define body part names functionally but not spatially. In another series of tasks, and in contrast to the above results, performances were normal when small objects, attached to the patient's body, served as pointing targets. Furthermore, on subsequent testing she pointed correctly at the remembered position of these objects. The fact that the same point in 'body space' is localized correctly when it corresponds to an external object and erroneously when it corresponds to a body part contradicts the idea of the body schema as a unitary function. Learning the position of objects on the body surface requires access to some form of body-reference system on which this information can be mapped. We argue that such a system can be available in autotopagnosia and is independent from the visuospatial representations of the body structure that are postulated to be damaged or inaccessible in this syndrome. An integrated account of the present results and of those reported by other authors suggests that multiple levels of representation (e.g., sensorimotor, visuospatial, semantic) are involved in the organization of body knowledge. 
5	Increasing asthma prevalence in a rural New Zealand adolescent population: 1975-89. A survey of asthma symptoms and spirometry in 435 adolescent schoolchildren was undertaken in 1989 in a rural, largely Maori population. The survey questionnaires were identical to those used in a 1975 survey at the same school. The prevalence of reported asthma or wheeze significantly increased from 26.2% to 34.0%. This increase occurred in groups reporting asthma, and also those reporting wheeze unassociated with colds, but without a previous diagnosis of asthma. There was a tendency for a rise in reported wheeze in Europeans (24.3% to 27.4%) and a significant rise in Maoris (27.1% to 36.2%). The reclassification of other respiratory problems did not account for the increase. Data from this study provides evidence that there has been a rise in the prevalence of asthma in this New Zealand population over a time period of 14 years. 
5	Usefulness of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in improving survival of patients with severely depressed left ventricular function associated with coronary artery disease. Clinical outcome was analyzed among a group of 39 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease, left ventricular (LV) ejection fractions less than 30% and arrhythmias that required an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) in an attempt to better define the role of the device in patients with severely depressed LV function. Twenty-nine (74%) were survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and 10 (26%) had ventricular tachycardia that was refractory to electrophysiologically guided antiarrhythmic therapy. The study group had the following demographic characteristics: 90% were men, mean age was 64 years (range 41 to 79) and mean LV ejection fraction was 21 +/- 4%. Concomitant pharmacotherapy included antiarrhythmic drugs 31 (79%), vasodilators in 22 (56%) and digoxin in 20 (51%). There was no statistical difference in baseline characteristics between survivors and nonsurvivors. Patients were followed for a mean of 24 months (range 2 to 72) from implantation. The difference between actuarial survival--77% at 1 year and 72% at 2 years--and projected survival without the AICD (patients who survive without appropriate device discharge)--30% at 1 year and 21% at 2 years--was significant (p less than 0.01 and less than 0.05 at 1 and 2 years, respectively). This study suggests that the AICD improves survival in patients with coronary artery disease despite severely depressed LV function. 
5	Stress-related mucosal damage: review of drug therapy. The increased awareness of stress-related mucosal damage (SRMD) that accompanied the widespread use of fiberoptic endoscopy and the increased incidence of SRMD that accompanied the advances in caring for critically ill patients resulted in the recognition that the majority of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting wil develop mucosal damage. Complications of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in these patients may contribute significantly to their morbidity and mortality, and the consequences of this bleeding may be more severe than the underlying predisposing conditions. Because of the importance of gastric acid in the pathogenesis of SRMD, therapy has focused on reduction of the intraluminal acid concentration. Acid neutralization, while effective, is laborious and associated with side effects. H2-receptor antagonists have been used successfully in the prophylaxis and treatment of SRMD and offer the potential for an effective parenteral as well as oral agent. They obviate the need for frequent antacid administration and eliminate some of the troubles and side effects that accompany an intensive antacid regimen. Of the available H2-receptor antagonists, cimetidine has been the most thoroughly evaluated. It is equivalent to antacids in the prevention of overt bleeding and offers the advantage of dosing flexibility, ease of administration, and a remarkable safety profile. Cimetidine has also been shown to be effective when administered by intermittent bolus infusions given every 8, 6, or 4 h or by primed continuous infusion, which has proven to be the most successful method of controlling intragastric pH. 
2	A biphasic pattern of anti-pre-S responses in acute hepatitis B virus infection. The clinical relevance of the immune response to the translation products of the pre-S1 and pre-S2 regions of hepatitis B virus was examined by testing sequential serum samples from 17 patients with acute self-limited hepatitis B and from two patients in whom chronic liver disease developed. Anti-pre-S antibodies were determined by enzyme immunoassays based on the inhibition of binding of monoclonal antibodies to epitopes in the pre-S1 and pre-S2 sequence. In acute, self-limited infection, anti-pre-S antibodies appeared in a biphasic pattern. The early antibodies were detected at the time of clinical signs of acute disease when HBsAg and often HBeAg were present, but hepatitis B virus DNA was no longer detectable in serum. Anti-pre-S levels then fell, but subsequently reappeared as the late antibody during the recovery phase, after development of anti-HBe, but before anti-HBs. Anti-pre-S responses were detected in 15 of 17 patients who recovered (88.2%) and in both patients with acute hepatitis B virus infection evolving to chronic liver disease. Although the early antibodies to pre-S1 and pre-S2 proteins appeared at the time of decreasing levels of infectious virus in serum in cases of self-limited infection, these antibodies also were transiently or continuously present with high levels of serum hepatitis B virus DNA in patients in whom chronic hepatitis B infection developed. Thus the anti-pre-S response in acute hepatitis is not a prognostic marker for clinical resolution. 
5	A controlled trial comparing vidarabine with acyclovir in neonatal herpes simplex virus infection. Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group. BACKGROUND. Despite the use of vidarabine, herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in neonates continues to be a disease of high morbidity and mortality. We undertook a controlled trial comparing vidarabine with acyclovir for the treatment of neonatal HSV infection. METHODS. Babies less than one month of age with virologically confirmed HSV infection were randomly and blindly assigned to receive either intravenous vidarabine (30 mg per kilogram of body weight per day; n = 95) or acyclovir (30 mg per kilogram per day; n = 107) for 10 days. Actuarial rates of mortality and morbidity among the survivors after one year were compared overall and according to the extent of the disease at entry into the study (infection confined to the skin, eyes, or mouth; encephalitis; or disseminated disease). RESULTS. After adjustment for differences between groups in the extent of disease, there was no difference between vidarabine and acyclovir in either morbidity (P = 0.83) or mortality (P = 0.27). None of the 85 babies with disease confined to the skin, eyes, or mouth died. Of the 31 babies in this group who were treated with vidarabine and followed for a year, 88 percent (22 of 25) were judged to be developing normally after one year, as compared with 98 percent (45 of 46) of the 54 treated with acyclovir (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -4 to 24). For the 71 babies with encephalitis, mortality was 14 percent with vidarabine (5 of 36) and with acyclovir (5 of 35); of the survivors, 43 percent (13 of 30) and 29 percent (8 of 28), respectively, were developing normally after one year (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -11 to 39). For the 46 babies with disseminated disease, mortality was 50 percent (14 of 28) with vidarabine and 61 percent (11 of 18) with acyclovir (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -20 to 40); of the survivors, 58 percent (7 of 12) and 60 percent (3 of 5), respectively, were judged to be developing normally after one year (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -40 to 50). Both medications were without serious toxic effects. CONCLUSIONS. In this multicenter, randomized, blinded study there were no differences in outcome between vidarabine and acyclovir in the treatment of neonatal HSV infection. The study lacked statistical power to determine whether there were sizable differences within the subgroups of those with localized HSV, encephalitis, or disseminated disease. 
5	Pentostatin induces durable remissions in hairy cell leukemia. Fifty patients with hairy cell leukemia were treated with pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin; dCF) for a median of 3 months; 32 (64%) patients achieved complete remission (CR), and 10 (20%) patients achieved partial remission (PR), for an overall response rate of 84%. After reaching maximal response, no maintenance therapy was administered. The median duration of follow-up is now 39 months, and only four of 32 patients in CR and two of 10 patients in PR have relapsed. dCF therapy produces durable long-term, disease-free survival in patients with hairy cell leukemia. 
5	Cytologic features of poorly differentiated 'insular' carcinoma of the thyroid, as revealed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. The authors report on the cytologic features of six cases of poorly differentiated "insular" carcinoma (IC) of the thyroid, a recently described variety of thyroid tumor intermediate between well-differentiated and anaplastic neoplasms. It is characterized by trabecular and/or alveolar growth patterns, merging with follicular areas, and by the absence of pleomorphism in the tumor cells. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) materials (both smears and cell-block preparations) from six patients were reviewed after the diagnosis of IC was confirmed on the surgical specimen. The following cytologic features were consistently found: high cellularity and necrotic background; low grade of atypia; trabeculae and/or clusters, possibly associated with microfollicles, of cells with poorly defined cytoplasm; and cytoplasmic vacuoles containing thyroglobulin. Nuclear inclusions and grooving of the nuclear surface were additional features. Preoperative diagnosis suggestive of IC might be of value for planning surgical treatment and subsequent therapy. 
1	Cutaneous manifestations of multiple myeloma. We report the cutaneous manifestations of multiple myeloma, using a retrospective review of 115 patients' records obtained from tumor registry files. Five patients were found to have biopsy-proved extramedullary plasmacytomas without extension from an underlying bony focus. Twelve patients had ecchymoses without thrombocytopenia; two of them had biopsy-proved amyloidosis. One patient presented with pyoderma gangrenosum and was subsequently diagnosed with multiple myeloma. The last patient initially presented with what clinically appeared to be leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and, in the course of a standard workup, he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. These findings are discussed with regard to the current literature on the cutaneous manifestations of multiple myeloma. 
5	Steal-prone coronary anatomy and myocardial ischemia associated with four primary anesthetic agents in humans. To examine the relationship between myocardial ischemia in patients with steal-prone coronary anatomy and the administration of isoflurane anesthesia, we reviewed coronary angiograms of 955 patients who had participated in a randomized trial of the use of one of four primary anesthetics for coronary artery bypass operations. Steal-prone anatomy was found in 31.8% of patients who had received enflurane; 40.0%, halothane; 32.6%, isoflurane; and 31.7%, sufentanil. Detected by greater than or equal to 0.1 mV ST segment displacement, ischemia during anesthesia occurred in 290 (30.4%) of all patients with no difference in the incidence among the four primary anesthetics (27.5%-32.9%). Patients with steal-prone anatomy did not suffer more ischemia than patients who needed coronary artery bypass surgery but with other varieties of coronary anatomy. In patients with steal-prone coronary anatomy, the incidence of myocardial ischemia by primary anesthetic was 24.0% with enflurane, 34.4% with halothane, 32.1% with isoflurane, and 38.2% with sufentanil. Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg during anesthesia occurred in 416 (45.6%) patients and was twice as common during administration of volatile anesthetics than during that of sufentanil. Hypotension did not increase ischemia frequency in patients with steal-prone anatomy with use of any of the four primary anesthetics including isoflurane. Ischemia was temporally related to hypotension in only 9 patients (0.9%). In none of the 42 patients who had steal-prone anatomy and hypotension during isoflurane anesthesia was ischemia temporally related to hypotension. 
1	Ewing's sarcoma. Radiotherapy versus surgery for local control. Significant strides in the treatment of Ewing's sarcoma, the second most common bone tumor of childhood, have resulted in cure for approximately 50% of patients. Successful therapy requires systemic chemotherapy for the eradication of microscopic or overt metastatic disease and surgery or irradiation therapy for control of the primary lesion. The article debates the controversy over the extent to which surgical resection should play a role in the local management of this disease. 
3	Tethered cord syndrome from a choristoma of mullerian origin. Case report. The authors report a case of tethered cord syndrome due to a choristoma of mullerian origin located in the spinal cord at the lumbosacral junction. Two similar cases were found upon review of the literature. The embryology of this lesion is discussed. 
1	Immunohistochemical detection of P-glycoprotein in endometrial adenocarcinoma. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) has emerged as the central mediator in classic multidrug resistance in model systems in vitro. High levels of Pgp also have been detected in many normal human tissues and tumors; and its role in clinical drug resistance is currently under investigation. Recently significant levels of Pgp were localized to gravid and secretory endometrium; and it was demonstrated that the combination of estrogen and progesterone is sufficient to induce high levels of both Pgp mRNA and Pgp in uterine secretory epithelium. These findings suggest that increased Pgp expression also may be present in hormone-responsive malignancies such as endometrial adenocarcinoma. To determine whether Pgp is expressed in endometrial adenocarcinoma, 36 endometrial adenocarcinomas (grade I [n = 17]; grade II [n = 6]; grade III [n = 13]) were investigated retrospectively by the avidin-biotin-complex immunohistochemical procedure using three murine monoclonal antibodies (MAb) MAb C219, MAb C494, and MAb JSB-1, which recognize spatially distinct cytoplasmic epitopes of Pgp. Seventy-two percent of the tumors showed positive immunostaining with at least one MAb; 67% showed immunostaining with MAb C219, 50% with MAb C494, and 62% with MAb JSB-1. Forty-six percent of tumors were immunoreactive to two and 29% to all three antibodies. Membranous and Golgi/paranuclear type staining patterns were observed. Overall the intensity of immunostaining varied from one sample to another for a given tumor type, and considerable heterogeneity of expression was commonly seen within a given tumor. Strong to moderate immunoreactivity was seen in diffusely infiltrating, adenosquamous, and serous papillary carcinomas. In general, immunoreactivity to MAb C494 was weaker than MAb C219 or MAb JSB-1. Adenomatous and non-neoplastic endometrium adjacent to the tumors displayed strong membranous immunostaining with MAb JSB-1. Endometrial capillaries showed weak-to-moderate immunostaining to all three antibodies. It is concluded that Pgp is commonly expressed in endometrial adenocarcinoma and may be a significant factor responsible for their drug-resistant nature subject to modulation by progesterone. 
3	Acute phase reactants and risk of bacterial meningitis among febrile infants and children. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that quantitation of either C-reactive protein (CRP) or the total peripheral WBC count can improve clinical detection of underlying bacterial meningitis among young febrile children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of selected symptoms of central nervous system infection, signs of meningeal irritation and/or elevated intracranial pressure, levels of CRP in serum, and total peripheral WBC counts among unselected pediatric patients undergoing lumbar punctures for evaluation of acute febrile illnesses. SETTING: Emergency department and acute care "walk-in" clinic of an urban, university-affiliated general hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 160 previously well, acutely febrile infants and children (median age, 6 months). RESULTS: The prevalence of bacterial meningitis was 6%. Sensitivity of symptoms was 1.00 and specificity was 0.17. Sensitivity of signs was 0.70 and specificity was 0.81. Of the acute phase reactants, sensitivity of a CRP level of more than 1.0 mg/dL was 0.80, while that of a total peripheral WBC count of more than 15,000/mm3 was 0.40. The presence of signs and/or a CRP level of more than 1.0 mg/dL correctly identified all children with bacterial meningitis (sensitivity, 1.00). The absence of signs and a CRP level of 1.0 mg/dL or less correctly identified 71 of 150 children without bacterial meningitis (specificity, 0.47). Of 125 children without meningeal signs, the combination of symptoms and a CRP level of more than 1.0 mg/dL correctly identified all three children with bacterial meningitis (sensitivity, 1.00). The absence of these symptoms and/or a CRP level of 1.0 mg/dL or less correctly identified 80 of 122 children without bacterial meningitis (specificity, 0.66). CONCLUSION: Quantitation of CRP but not the total peripheral WBC count can increase the sensitivity of physical examination findings and the specificity of symptoms for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Measurement of CRP in serum is useful as an adjunct to history and physical examination for the detection of acute bacterial meningitis in the acutely febrile child. 
1	Follicular thyroid cancer treated at the Mayo Clinic, 1946 through 1970: initial manifestations, pathologic findings, therapy, and outcome We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of all patients who received their primary treatment for follicular thyroid cancer at the Mayo Clinic between 1946 and 1970. The diagnosis was confirmed by reexamination of preserved tissue specimens. The 57 female and 43 male patients (mean age, 53 years) underwent follow-up for a maximum of 32 years (mean, 17.4 years). All patients were treated surgically, and total removal of primary tumor was thought to have been accomplished in all but three. Only 2 of the 88 patients without distant metastatic lesions at the time of initial diagnosis underwent ablation of the thyroid remnant. At the conclusion of the study, 52 patients had died, thyroid cancer being the cause of death in 19. On the basis of univariate survival analysis, age more than 50 years, tumor size that exceeded 3.9 cm, higher tumor grade, presence of marked vascular invasion, adjacent tissue invasion, and distant metastatic involvement at the time of initial diagnosis were associated with increased cancer mortality. Multivariate analysis (by Cox proportional hazards model), however, identified only age greater than 50 years, marked vascular invasion, and metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis to be independent predictors of follicular thyroid cancer-related mortality. Patients with two or more of these predictors were classified as being high risk. These patients had 5- and 20-year survival rates of 47% and 8%, respectively; the corresponding survival data for the low-risk group were 99% at 5 years and 86% at 20 years. The identification of these risk groups may facilitate a more rational approach to treatment of follicular thyroid cancer. 
5	Hypertension as a risk factor for epilepsy after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and surgery. A prospective, consecutive series of 307 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ranging from Grades 1 to V according to the classification of Hunt and Hess on admission were evaluated to determine the incidence of epilepsy 1 to 3 years (mean, 1.4 years) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and surgery. Sixty-three patients had died and one patient was lost to follow-up. Twenty-nine patients developed epileptic seizures after the SAH and surgery. The mean time from the SAH to epileptic seizure varied from 0 days (day of the SAH) to 2 years (mean, 6.7 months). The seizures were classified as focal in 9 patients (31%) and as generalized in 20 patients (69%). All patients received anticonvulsant medication after more than one seizure. The risk factors for development of posthemorrhagic/postoperative epilepsy were, in order of importance: a history of hypertension; an infarct on late computed tomographic scan; and the duration of coma after the ictus. Of the 85 patients with histories of hypertension, 17 (20.0%) developed epilepsy. Only 12 (5.4%) of the 222 nonhypertensive patients developed epileptic seizures. The difference between the groups was significant (P = 0.0001). Computed tomographic scans were undertaken in 237 patients 1 to 3 years (mean, 1.4 years) after the SAH and surgery. Postoperative epilepsy was significantly associated with infarcts visualized on computed tomographic scan (P = 0.0005). 
3	Mortality in acute stroke with atrial fibrillation. The Italian Acute Stroke Study Group. We compared 211 consecutive patients who had acute ischemic hemispheric stroke and atrial fibrillation with 837 consecutive patients who had stroke without atrial fibrillation. The atrial fibrillation group included a higher frequency of women, older subjects, and those with a severe neurologic deficit, abnormal computed tomogram, and elevated heart rate. The 1-month case-fatality rate in the atrial fibrillation group was 27% while that in the group without atrial fibrillation was 14%. The 6-month case-fatality rates in the two groups were 40% and 20%, respectively. The risk of death attributable to atrial fibrillation, adjusted for the effect of other prognostic factors, was significant at 1 month (relative risk = 1.55) and at 6 months (relative risk = 1.74). The causes of death were equally distributed in the two groups during both the acute and subacute phases. We conclude that atrial fibrillation is a negative prognostic factor in patients hospitalized for acute stroke. Nevertheless, cerebral embolism alone does not completely explain the increase in mortality for stroke patients with atrial fibrillation. Other associated pathogenetic mechanisms must also be taken into account. 
5	Renal replacement treatment for diabetic patients in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Northern region, 1964-88. OBJECTIVES--To review the experience of renal replacement treatment in diabetic patients treated in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Northern region from 1964 to 1988, and to compare the morbidity and mortality of diabetic patients treated with dialysis or transplantation with those of matched controls of non-diabetic patients. DESIGN--Retrospective study of clinical case notes. SETTING--Renal units of the Northern region, particularly that in Newcastle upon Tyne. PATIENTS--All 65 diabetic patients treated by renal replacement treatment in Newcastle upon Tyne from 1964 to 1987; 42 diabetic patients were matched with 42 non-diabetic patients according to age, sex, year of starting treatment, and type of treatment (dialysis or transplantation). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Sex, age, renal biopsy findings, blood pressure, history of diabetic treatment, and plasma creatinine concentration at the start of renal replacement treatment. History of renal replacement treatments, suitability for transplantation, history of transplantation, cumulative survival, and cause of death during follow up. Survival of technique, cumulative survival of the first peritoneal catheter and history of peritonitis in patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis; source of graft, histocompatibility antigens, duration of associated stay in hospital, and graft survival in patients receiving renal or pancreatic transplant. RESULTS--1259 Patients with chronic renal failure were accepted for renal replacement treatment in Newcastle upon Tyne, of whom 65 (5%) had diabetes. The first was accepted in 1974, and between 1974 and 1980 another 15 were treated (mean age 42 years; 4% of new patients). From 1981 to 1987, 49 diabetic patients (mean age 44; 9% of new patients) were treated. Fifty patients (77%) had insulin dependent diabetes and the remaining 15 (23%) non-insulin dependent diabetes. On average, the patients were aged 25 (range 5-57) when diabetes was first diagnosed and 44 (range 24-70) at the start of renal replacement treatment. The mean age at the start of treatment was 40 for patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes and 58 for patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes. Transplantation was performed in 33 of the diabetic patients, whose mean age was lower than that of those who did not receive a transplant (41 v 48 respectively, p less than 0.05). Comparison between the 42 diabetic patients and matched controls showed that the overall survival at five years was 46% and 77% respectively. The three year survival of the diabetic patients who did not receive a transplant was poor (41% v 79% respectively). Of patients transplanted, survival at five years was 73% in the diabetic patients and 90% in the controls. However, there was no significant difference in the five year graft survival (64% v 46% respectively). CONCLUSIONS--Diabetes adversely affects morbidity and mortality in patients having renal replacement treatment, but renal transplantation seems to be the best option for treating diabetic patients with end stage renal failure. 
5	Acute urinary retention secondary to Herpes simplex meningitis. We report a case of acute urinary retention in a 24-year-old man with Herpes simplex meningitis without genital lesions. Since the differential diagnosis in young patients who present with acute urinary retention also includes multiple sclerosis, lumbosacral disk herniation, rheumatological disorders and drug intoxication, a thorough history and careful neurological examination are of paramount importance in distinguishing these syndromes. As part of a directed neurological evaluation prompt performance of lumbar puncture is indicated; a lymphocytic pleocytosis is suggestive of herpetic meningitis. Culture of Herpes simplex virus from the cerebrospinal fluid should be attempted. We recommend conservative management only, typically with intermittent catheterization, since bladder function usually normalizes within 10 to 14 days. 
5	Indications for computed tomography in children with blunt abdominal trauma. This investigation was undertaken to identify clinical variables, alone or in combination, that could be used to assign children to high- and low-risk categories for intra-abdominal injury following blunt trauma. Six hundred consecutive children who were examined with computed tomography (CT) following blunt trauma were enrolled. Complete data sets were available on 375 children. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify predictor variables for the presence of abdominal injury. There were 174 children with abdominal injury detected by CT. Of these, 95 were classified as having significant injury. Indicators associated with significantly higher risk of abdominal injury included the following: more than three clinical indications given (odds likelihood ratio [OLR] = 4.60, 95% confidence interval [95% Cl] = 2.29, 9.21, p less than 0.001); gross hematuria (OLR = 5.80, 95% Cl = 2.51, 13.4, p less than 0.001); lap belt injury (OLR = 12.2, 95% Cl = 2.22, 66.8, p less than 0.01); assault or abuse as the mechanism of injury (OLR = 5.08, 95% Cl = 1.07, 24.2, p less than 0.05); abdominal tenderness (OLR = 2.73, 95% Cl = 1.296, 5.82, p less than 0.01); and Trauma Score less than or equal to 12 (OLR = 2.27, 95% Cl = 1.006, 5.13, p less than 0.01). No child with asymptomatic hematuria (n = 56), regardless of grade or neurologic impairment in the absence of abdominal findings (n = 15), had an abnormal CT examination. These data are useful as an adjunct to clinical judgment in triage when the availability of CT equipment is limited or there are competing extra-abdominal injuries. 
3	Lexical organization of nouns and verbs in the brain. The analysis of neuropsychological disorders of lexical processing has provided important clues about the general organization of the lexical system and the internal structure of the processing components. Reports of patients with selective dysfunction of specific semantic categories such as abstract versus concrete words, living things versus inanimate objects, animals, fruits and vegetables, proper names and so forth, support the hypothesis that the neural organization of the semantic processing component is organized in these categories. There are reports of selective dysfunction of the grammatical categories noun and verb, suggesting that a dimension of lexical organization is the grammatical class of words. But the results reported in these studies have not provided unambiguous evidence concerning two fundamental questions about the nature and the locus of this organization within the lexical system. Is the noun-verb distinction represented in the semantic or in the phonological and orthographic lexicons? Is grammatical-class knowledge represented independently of lexical forms or is it represented separately and redundantly within each modality-specific lexicon? Here we report the performance of two brain-damaged subjects with modality-specific deficits restricted principally (H.W.) or virtually only (S.J.D) to verbs in oral and written production, respectively. The contrasting performance suggests that grammatical-class distinctions are redundantly represented in the phonological and orthographic output lexical components. 
5	Vitamin B6 in the treatment of the premenstrual syndrome--a review [published erratum appears in Br J Obstet Gynaecol 1991 Mar;98(3):329-30] A search of the literature yielded 12 controlled trials on vitamin B6 in the treatment of the premenstrual syndrome. These are discussed with emphasis on methodological aspects. A major drawback of the trials is the limited number of patients included. The existing evidence of positive effects of vitamin B6 is weak, and some well-designed trials with positive results would be needed to change this view. 
3	Ratio of immunochemically determined amniotic fluid acetylcholinesterase to butyrylcholinesterase in the differential diagnosis of fetal abnormalities. A total of 111 amniotic fluid samples, clear or blood stained, with elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase was analysed by immunoassays specific for acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase and the acetylcholinesterase/butyrylcholinesterase-ratios determined. Samples from 40 pregnancies associated with anencephaly, 47 pregnancies associated with open spina bifida or encephalocele and six pregnancies with fetal intrauterine death or miscarriage all had ratios of greater than 0.14. All 11 pregnancies with fetal ventral wall defects had ratios less than 0.14 as had four pregnancies with normal outcome and elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase. Three fetuses with both open spina bifida and ventral wall defects were associated with ratios above 0.14. These results suggest that immunochemical determination of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase can be used to distinguish pregnancies complicated by anencephaly, open spina bifida, encephalocele and miscarriage from those with ventral wall defects and samples with false positive elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase. The procedure is accurate and simple to carry out and well suited to routine use in a clinical chemistry laboratory. 
5	Colonic motor activity in acute colitis in conscious dogs. The changes in motor activity of the colon during acute colitis were investigated in six conscious dogs. The motor activity was recorded with seven strain-gauge transducers. Colitis was induced in the entire colon by luminal perfusion of acetic acid. The dogs exhibited urgency and diarrhea with mucus and blood during colitis. The mucosa was diffusely erythematous and friable and there were scattered ulcerations over the mucosal surface. The motor activity of the colon changed in several ways during colitis: (a) the total duration per hour and the mean duration of contractile states decreased significantly; (b) the cycle length of colonic migrating motor complexes was significantly prolonged, and the nonmigrating motor complexes were almost completely absent; and (d) the incidence of giant migrating contractions increased significantly. About half of the giant migrating contractions were followed by defecation. The remaining expelled mucus or gas. Sometimes, a migrating motor complex in the colon was also followed by defecation; this was never observed in the normal state. The motor activity of the colon was still decreased and the cycle length prolonged 21 days after induction of colitis. However, the dogs were asymptomatic at this time and the mucosa looked normal at colonoscopy. The incidence of giant migrating contractions was also normal at this time. It was concluded that the dog is a good model for the study of colitis because of the similarity of symptoms with human ulcerative colitis. The phasic contractions of the colon decreases during colitis but the incidence of giant migrating contractions is increased. The diarrhea in colitis may primarily be due to the large number of giant migrating contractions in the middle and the distal colon. 
1	Ki67 index and S-phase fraction in human breast carcinomas. Comparison and correlations with prognostic factors. In a prospective study of 148 consecutive breast adenocarcinomas, proliferative indices of the same surgical tumor sample were performed by immunohistologic staining (Ki67 index) with the use of the Ki67 monoclonal antibody, which binds to a nuclear antigen only expressed in cycling cells, and by flow cytometry-derived S-phase fraction (SPF). Measurable Ki67 and SPF indices were obtained in 142 cases and 99 cases, respectively, and in 96 cases by both methods. In aneuploid tumors, a significant but low (P less than 0.05, r = 0.3) relationship was observed between Ki67 index and SPF. When compared with clinical, pathologic, and biochemical parameters these two proliferative indices were shown to be associated with nuclear grading and mitotic index. Additionally, correlations were observed between Ki67 index and node involvement (P less than 0.02) and between SPF and estrogen receptors (P = 0.002). These results show that (1) proliferative indices are obtained in 96% of surgical samples with Ki67 versus 67% with SPF and that (2) Ki67 index and SPF may provide complementary data with respect to prognosis. 
5	Effects of menstrual phase and amenorrhea on exercise performance in runners. There are few well controlled studies in terms of subject selection, menstrual classification, and exercise protocol that have examined both maximal and submaximal exercise responses during different phases of the menstrual cycle in eumenorrheic runners and compared these runners to amenorrheic runners. Thus, the purpose of this study was to measure selected physiological and metabolic responses to maximal and submaximal exercise during two phases of the menstrual cycle in eumenorrheic runners and amenorrheic runners. Eight eumenorrheic runners (29.0 +/- 4.2 yr) and eight amenorrheic runners (24.5 +/- 5.7 yr) matched for physical, gynecological, and training characteristics were studied. The eumenorrheic runners performed one maximal and one submaximal (40 min at 80% VO2max) treadmill run during both the early follicular (days 2-4) and midluteal (6-8 d from LH surge) phases. The amenorrheic runners performed one maximal and one submaximal (40 min at 80% VO2max) treadmill run. Cycle phases were documented by urinary luteinizing hormone and progesterone assays and by plasma estradiol and progesterone assays. No differences were observed in oxygen uptake, minute ventilation, heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio, rating of perceived exertion, time to fatigue (maximal), and plasma lactate (following the maximal and submaximal exercise tests) between the follicular and luteal phases in the eumenorrheic runners and the amenorrheic runners. We conclude that neither menstrual phase (follicular vs luteal) nor menstrual status (eumenorrheic vs amenorrheic) alters or limits exercise performance in female athletes. 
4	Radiographic manifestations of anomalies of the lung. Congenital nonvascular anomalies of the lung can be subdivided into those affecting the bronchial tree and those affecting parenchymal abnormalities. Embryologic development of the lung is briefly reviewed to facilitate an understanding of developmental pulmonary anomalies. Clinical, radiographic, and therapeutic aspects of these anomalies are discussed. 
3	Clarifying confusion: the confusion assessment method. A new method for detection of delirium OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a new standardized confusion assessment method (CAM) that enables nonpsychiatric clinicians to detect delirium quickly in high-risk settings. DESIGN: Prospective validation study. SETTING: Conducted in general medicine wards and in an outpatient geriatric assessment center at Yale University (site 1) and in general medicine wards at the University of Chicago (site 2). PATIENTS: The study included 56 subjects, ranging in age from 65 to 98 years. At site 1, 10 patients with and 20 without delirium participated; at site 2, 16 patients with and 10 without delirium participated. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: An expert panel developed the CAM through a consensus building process. The CAM instrument, which can be completed in less than 5 minutes, consists of nine operationalized criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R). An a priori hypothesis was established for the diagnostic value of four criteria: acute onset and fluctuating course, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. The CAM algorithm for diagnosis of delirium required the presence of both the first and the second criteria and of either the third or the fourth criterion. At both sites, the diagnoses made by the CAM were concurrently validated against the diagnoses made by psychiatrists. At sites 1 and 2 values for sensitivity were 100% and 94%, respectively; values for specificity were 95% and 90%; values for positive predictive accuracy were 91% and 94%; and values for negative predictive accuracy were 100% and 90%. The CAM algorithm had the highest predictive accuracy for all possible combinations of the nine features of delirium. The CAM was shown to have convergent agreement with four other mental status tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination. The interobserver reliability of the CAM was high (kappa = 0.81 - 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: The CAM is sensitive, specific, reliable, and easy to use for identification of delirium. 
1	The mutation for medullary thyroid carcinoma with parathyroid tumors (MTC with PTs) is closely linked to the centromeric region of chromosome 10. Two new morphs (F and G) detected by the centromeric alpha satellite probe p alpha 10RP8 and D10Z1 in HinfI digests are linked to the PstI polymorphisms of D10Z1, confirming their chromosome 10 location. The F and G morphs were in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other but were in weak linkage disequilibrium with the A and B morphs defined in PstI digests. Data for haplotypes formed by using the A and F morphs improved the lod score for linkage between the disease locus for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) and D10Z1 (Z = 14.06 at theta = 0) in the six large families studied by Wu et al. Furthermore, the locus that codes for a distinct phenotype, medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with parathyroid tumors (PTs) and no pheochromocytomas (PHEOs) (referred to as MTC with PTs), in one of the families was closely linked to two markers, D10Z1 and RBP3, with lodscores of 2.86 and 3.54, respectively, at theta = 0. A possible allelic association was noted between disease phenotypes and centromeric haplotypes. The phenotype MTC and PHEOs with and without PTs was associated with the same relatively common centromeric haplotype (A + B-F-G-) in the four families in which all four morphs could be determined, while the phenotype MTC with PTs was associated with the rare centromeric haplotype (A-B-F-G+) in one family. 
4	The Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry: overview of acute hemodynamic results and procedural complications. Between December 1, 1986 and October 30, 1987, balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed in 492 patients with aortic stenosis (mean age 79 +/- 8.4 years) enrolled in the Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry. All procedures were performed from a femoral approach (92%), brachial approach (6%) or transseptal approach (2%) and utilized either a single balloon technique (72%) or a double balloon technique (28%). Valvuloplasty resulted in a significant improvement in aortic valve area (0.50 +/- 0.18 cm2 to 0.82 +/- 0.30 cm2), mean aortic valve gradient (60 +/- 23 mm Hg to 30 +/- 13 mm Hg) and cardiac output (3.86 +/- 1.26 to 4.05 +/- 1.31 liters/min). Serial aortography demonstrated a moderate or severe increase in aortic insufficiency in only 2.1% of patients. Statistical analysis of the procedural factors affecting acute valvuloplasty results demonstrated significant correlations of single versus double balloon technique, total number of balloon inflations and total number of balloon exchanges with respect to the absolute change in mean aortic valve gradient occurring during the valvuloplasty procedure. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the maximal time of valvuloplasty balloon inflation with aortic valve area measured after valvuloplasty, and there were significant correlations of the total number of balloon inflations and total number of balloon exchanges with the aortic valve mean gradient measured after valvuloplasty. The overall complication rate for the procedure was 20.5%, including vascular injury in 11%, embolic phenomenon in 2.2%, ventricular perforation resulting in tamponade in 1.8%, massive aortic insufficiency in 1%, nonfatal arrhythmia in 0.8% and myocardial infarction in 0.2%. 
3	Meralgia paresthetica after coronary bypass surgery. Meralgia paresthetica is a neurologic disorder characterized by localized paresthesia and numbness on the anterolateral aspect of the thigh and involving the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. It involves no motor deficits. Meralgia paresthetica, which may result from a variety of causes, has been observed as a rare complication in heart operations. Its cause when associated with such operations is uncertain but may be prolonged relaxed positioning on the operating table and recovery room stretcher. Another possible cause of meralgia paresthetica after heart operations is the "frog-leg" position of the legs during vein harvesting. Patients with this condition should be advised of its untreatable, but benign and self-limiting, nature. 
1	Modified anterior compartment resection. In the majority of patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the anterior compartment of the thigh, it is possible to preserve a small portion of the quadriceps with intact nerve supply without compromising on the radicality of the procedure or the local control rate. The distal one-third of the vastus medialis can usually be spared with a long, slender branch providing its innervation. Dissection of the femoral nerve below the inguinal ligament and its branch(es) to an uninvolved area of the quadricepts the farthest from the location of the tumor is essential. This modified anterior compartment resection improves dramatically the function of the extremity. 
1	Pheochromocytoma in the pediatric age group: the prostate--an unusual location. Pheochromocytomas of the prostate are rare, with only 3 cases in adults reported in the literature. We present the case of an 8-year-old boy with a pheochromocytoma of the prostate and a second tumor in the region of the left internal iliac artery. 
1	Recombinative events of the T cell antigen receptor delta gene in peripheral T cell lymphomas. Recombinative events of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) delta-chain gene were studied in 37 cases of peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) and related to their clinical presentation and the expression of the alpha beta or gamma delta heterodimers as determined by immunostaining of frozen tissue samples. There were 22 cases of alpha beta, 5 cases of gamma delta, and 10 cases of silent TCR expressing neither the alpha beta nor gamma delta TCR. 5 different probes were used to examine the delta locus. The 22 cases of alpha beta PTCL displayed biallelic and monoallelic deletions; a monoallelic V delta 1 J delta 1 rearrangement was observed in 1 case and a monoallelic germ line configuration in 7 cases. The 5 cases of gamma delta PTCL displayed biallelic rearrangements: the productive rearrangements could be ascribed to V delta 1J delta 1 joining in 3 cases and VJ delta 1 joining in 2 cases according to the combined pattern of DNA hybridization with the appropriate probes and of cell reactivity with the TCR delta-1, delta TCS-1, and anti-V delta 2 monoclonal antibodies. In the VJ delta 1 joining, the rearranged V segments were located between V delta 1 and V delta 2. Interestingly, in the third group of 10 cases of silent PTCL, 5 cases were found to have a TCR gene configuration identical to that in the TCR alpha beta PTCL, as demonstrated by biallelic delta gene deletion. These 5 cases were CD3 positive. The 5 remaining cases showed a monoallelic delta gene rearrangement with a monoallelic germ line configuration in 4 and a monoallelic deletion in 1. Four of these cases were CD3 negative, which was consistent with an immature genotype the TCR commitent of which could not be ascertained. Finally, TCR gamma delta PTCL consisted of a distinct clinical morphological and molecular entity whereas TCR alpha beta and silent PTCL had a similar presentation. 
5	Neonatal repair of tetralogy of Fallot with and without pulmonary atresia. Our experience with the arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries has confirmed the attainability of excellent results with elective neonatal surgery. Up to this time, we have repaired tetralogy of Fallot during the neonatal period only when symptoms, either severe persistent cyanosis or cyanotic spells, have been present. This review assesses the results of such nonelective neonatal correction of tetralogy between 1973 and 1988. Twenty-seven neonates with either symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot or symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot with valvar pulmonary atresia underwent repair. Mean age at repair was 8 +/- 8.4 days and mean weight was 3.0 +/- 0.7 kg. Unsatisfactory palliative shunts had previously been placed elsewhere in four patients. Twenty-five transannular patches and two conduits were used for reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract. There were five deaths in the hospital, three of which were due to avoidable technical problems. All deaths occurred in patients with pulmonary artery (Nakata) index less than 150 mm2/m2. One premature child weighing 2.3 kg displayed an absent pulmonary valve-like syndrome after repair and died late of respiratory complications caused by aneurysmal branch pulmonary arteries. Actuarial survival at 5 years was 74%. There was a single rapidly declining hazard phase for death, with the hazard approaching zero at 1 1/2 years after repair. Actuarial freedom from need for reoperation was 76% at 5 years. Postoperative catheterization of 15 long-term survivors showed right ventricular pressure less than 70% systemic in 13 cases. All patients are symptomatically well and functioning in sinus rhythm 1 to 15 years after repair (mean, 5 +/- 4 years). This experience with neonates with symptoms suggests that, if mortality is lower in the absence of symptoms, elective repair of tetralogy of Fallot could be reasonably undertaken during the first months of life. 
4	Cardiac rhythm disturbances early after orthotopic heart transplantation: prevalence and clinical importance of the observed abnormalities. To precisely define the incidence, type and consequences of cardiac arrhythmias early after heart transplantation, 25 cardiac transplant recipients were monitored continuously for 728 days from the day of surgery to discharge or death. A subset of 15 patients had sinus node function studies with overdrive suppression performed weekly at the time of endomyocardial biopsy. Results revealed sinus bradycardia in 10 patients (40%) and junctional bradycardia in 6 (24%). Supraventricular tachycardia in the form of atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter occurred in 11 patients (44%). Ventricular tachycardia occurred in 15 patients (60%) and was nonsustained in all. Cardiac pacing for 1,403 h was used in nine patients with a pulse rate less than 50 beats/min; seven recovered and permanent pacing was instituted in two. In the subgroup that had sinus node function studies, seven patients were identified with clinical bradyarrhythmia; each had abnormal sinus node recovery time (greater than 1,400 ms) and abnormal corrected sinus node recovery time (greater than 525 ms) in at least one study. These seven patients also had a significantly prolonged ischemic time (236 +/- 26 versus 159 +/- 68 min, p less than 0.01). In conclusion, cardiac arrhythmias, particularly ventricular tachycardia and bradyarrhythmia, occur more commonly early after orthotopic heart transplantation than has previously been reported. Sinus node dysfunction due to prolonged organ ischemic time, antiarrhythmic drug use or surgical trauma, alone or in combination, may contribute to these arrhythmias. 
2	Quantitation of intrinsic drug-metabolizing capacity in human liver biopsy specimens: support for the intact-hepatocyte theory. Hepatic drug metabolism is decreased in patients with severe liver disease, but it is unclear to what extent this is due to altered hepatic blood flow or reduced intrinsic metabolic capacity. In this study we quantitated in needle-biopsy specimens the intrinsic capacity of liver tissue from 67 patients with mild liver disease (n = 36), chronic active hepatitis (n = 16) and cirrhosis (n = 15) to metabolize two model compounds in vitro. Hydroxylation of the low-extraction drug bufuralol resulted in the formation of 251 +/- 25 nmol 1'OH-bufuralol/gm wet wt/hr in mildly diseased liver tissue and was significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced in liver tissue exhibiting chronic active hepatitis (166 +/- 23 nmol/gm wet wt/hr) and cirrhosis (124 +/- 21 nmol/gm wet wt/hr). The formation rates of monoethylglycinexylidide, the main metabolite of the high-extraction drug lidocaine, varied widely and were not significantly different among the three groups. To relate the drug-metabolizing capacity to the hepatocyte content of liver tissue, morphometrical study was performed in the biopsy pieces originally submitted. The metabolic activity of each biopsy piece was then related to the fractional volume of hepatocytes it was calculated to contain. In mildly diseased liver tissue 355 +/- 35 nmol 1'OH-bufuralol/ml hepatocytes x hr or 12.4 +/- 1.0 mumol monoethylglycinexylidide/ml hepatocytes x hr- and in cirrhotic liver tissue 306 +/- 49 nmol 1'OH-bufuralol/ml hepatocytes x hr or 15.3 +/- 3.0 mumol monoethylglycinexylidide/ml hepatocytes x hr--were formed, respectively, and these differences were not significant. 
5	Carotid artery resection and replacement in patients with head and neck malignant tumors. Tumor involvement of the carotid artery with head and neck cancers may be present either simultaneously with the primary lesion or more often appears at a later date following resection of the primary tumor. Management of the secondary tumor consists of its resection together with the involved carotid artery with or without carotid artery reconstruction. The Authors are convinced that the best chance for cure of patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers involving the carotid artery is radical extirpation with ablative surgery in the form of en block resection of the primary lesion, the secondary tumor, and the involved carotid artery followed by immediate revascularization. This bold approach was carried out in two male patients, 48 and 61 years of age, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy in one and radiation therapy alone in the other, with excellent results. Dermal grafts were placed over the entire length of the arterialized veins to protect them from radiation injury. Based on this limited experience and excellent results, we recommend this one-stage surgical ablative procedure in well selected patients. However, cooperation between the ENT and vascular surgeons, strict adherence to the principles and techniques of vascular surgery, and coverage of the arterialized vein with a dermal graft is absolutely essential. 
5	The treatment of chondrodermatitis nodularis with cartilage removal alone. Fifty-eight patients with chondrodermatitis nodularis on the antihelix in 24 ears (16 women and eight men) and the helix in 40 ears (six women and 34 men) were studied. Twelve ears responded to intralesional steroid therapy. Under local anesthetic, 46 operations were performed to remove cartilage without skin excision. On the helix, a longitudinal incision was made; on the antihelix, a flap was raised and the underlying cartilage was excised, taking care to leave no rough cartilage edges. Follow-up (mean, 16 months; range, 4.5 to 34 months) showed that 10 of 17 antihelix lesions and 24 of 29 helix lesions healed completely with excellent cosmetic results. Recurrences, requiring further treatment, occurred at cartilage-excision margins in seven ears, and further cartilage excision alone was successful in four ears. This study demonstrates that only cartilage needs to be removed in the surgical treatment of chondrodermatitis nodularis. 
3	The influence of the calcium antagonist nimodipine and induced hypertension on the behavior of the cerebral pial arteries, the blood-brain barrier, cerebral edema, and cerebral infarction in cats with one-hour occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Thirty anesthetized cats were randomly assigned to one of three groups of 10 cats each: nimodipine treatment, nimodipine treatment combined with induced hypertension, or a control group. The behavior of the cerebral pial arteries was measured by means of microscopic observation through a cranial window. The middle cerebral artery of each cat was clipped for 1 hour via the transorbital approach. Five hours after circulation was reestablished in the middle cerebral artery, Evans blue dye was injected intravenously: 30 minutes later, the animal was killed. Administration of nimodipine or saline in the treated or control group was started 5 minutes before the middle cerebral artery was clipped and maintained until the end of the experiment. Induced hypertension was produced by administration of dopamine during the occlusion. Damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was judged by extravasation of Evans blue dye. Cerebral edema and infarction were evaluated from histological findings. They were most prominent in the control group: the extent of hemisphere affected was as follows (mean +/- standard error): extravasation, 40.5 +/- 8.8%; edema, 43.2 +/- 5.7%; infarction, 35.5 +/- 9.6%. On the other hand, the extravasation of Evans blue dye and cerebral edema were significantly more extensive in the group treated with nimodipine and induced hypertension (extravasation, 28.2 +/- 9.6% of the hemisphere; edema, 30.3 +/- 7.1%) than in the group treated with nimodipine alone (extravasation, 18.5 +/- 8.7% of the hemisphere; edema, 19.4 +/- 6.3%), but the infarction size was similar in both groups (16.6 +/- 4.9% of the hemisphere in the former; 17.0 +/- 6.2 in the latter). 
1	Heffalumps, jagulars, and cheshire cats. A commentary on cytokeratins and soft tissue sarcomas. Historically, antibodies to cytokeratin intermediate filaments have been models of target specificity. In most diagnostic settings, the utility of these antibodies was unquestioned; reactivity for cytokeratin was dogmatically equated with epithelial differentiation. Recently, however, the diagnostic importance of these antibodies has been challenged, prompted by the demonstration of cytokeratin reactivity in a variety of "nonepithelial" neoplasms. In this review, the evolving literature on this topic is explored, and the practical implications of these findings are discussed. 
3	The distribution of muscle weakness in upper motoneuron lesions affecting the lower limb. To determine the distribution of weakness in the lower limb after upper motoneuron lesions the strength of 8 muscle groups was measured. Four groups of patients were studied: 22 control subjects, 16 patients with unilateral leg paresis, 4 patients with severe unilateral paralysis and 5 patients with paraparesis. In the testing posture (seated), patients with cerebral upper motoneuron lesions showed no selective loss of power in flexors or extensors on the contralateral side. Gravitational torques were included in the measurements. However, proximal muscles (acting at hip and knee) were significantly less severely affected than more distal muscles (acting at ankle and hallux). At any particular joint, physiological flexors and extensors were affected equally in both the hemiparetic and paraparetic subjects. As in the upper limb (Colebatch and Gandevia, 1989), the strength of muscles on the clinically unaffected side was reduced compared with control subjects, although no muscle groups were especially affected. 
1	Role of percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy in suspected intrathoracic malignancy. Percutaneous fine-needle aspiration (PFNA) biopsy is an accepted technique for the diagnosis of suspected intrathoracic malignancy, but the appropriate indications for its use have not been clearly defined. To help establish guidelines, we performed a retrospective analysis of 188 patients who underwent PFNA biopsy for suspected intrathoracic malignancy. Biopsy led to a diagnosis in 72% (135/188) of the patients, but in 27% (50/188) samples were inadequate for cytological diagnosis, and in 2% (3/188) samples were adequate but failed to yield a diagnosis. Fifty-three patients underwent surgical intervention, thus allowing histological confirmation of the cytological diagnosis. In patients with a diagnosis from PFNA biopsy, operation confirmed malignancy in 97% (37/38) and a specific cell type in 79% (30/38). In patients without a diagnosis after biopsy, a malignancy was found in 73% (11/15) at the time of operation. This suggests a high rate of accuracy when PFNA biopsy provides a diagnosis. However, it also illustrates that a substantial percentage of PFNA biopsy attempts fail to yield a diagnosis in patients ultimately found to have malignancies. This implies that PFNA biopsy might best be reserved for patients who are not surgical candidates. 
5	Delayed brachial artery occlusion owing to a dog bite of the upper extremity. We report a case of delayed presentation of vascular injury from a superficial dog bite of the upper extremity in a five-year-old male. This example of a significant arterial injury, in the setting of seemingly minor trauma, is the first known report of blunt arterial trauma owing to a dog bite in any age group. Blunt arterial trauma in children is rare unless associated with fractures, dislocations, or massive crush injuries. Additionally, persistent pulses following arterial occlusion are rare and can potentially lead to misdiagnosis of a serious arterial injury. A brief review of pediatric blunt vascular injuries is presented with implications for diagnosis and management of such cases. 
5	Effect of amiodarone on erythrocyte shape and membrane properties. 1. Amiodarone is a potent anti-arrhythmic drug with lipophilic properties. The intercalation of such a drug into the membrane of erythrocytes may alter their shape and have an impact on the flow properties of blood. We therefore studied the influence of amiodarone on erythrocyte shape and deformability in vitro and in vivo. 2. Incubation in vitro with increasing amiodarone concentrations led to a progressive stomatocytic shape transformation and a decreased deformability of the erythrocytes. 3. Amiodarone treatment in eight patients did not affect erythrocyte morphology and deformability. However, an increase in the membrane cholesterol/phospholipid ratio was found. 4. The stomatocytic shape transformation of erythrocytes in vitro indicates that amiodarone intercalates in the inner hemileaflet of the lipid bilayer leading to membrane internalization. These results shed light on the interaction of amiodarone with biomembranes. 
5	Comparison of frequency of late potentials in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathy with advanced congestive heart failure and their usefulness in predicting sudden death. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms were obtained in 62 consecutive patients with advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) undergoing evaluation for possible heart transplantation to determine if late potentials: (1) provide unique information compared to assessment of ventricular ectopic activity on ambulatory electrocardiogram, and (2) identify a subgroup of CHF patients with higher sudden death risk. Patients with a history of cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia were excluded. CHF was due to old myocardial infarction in 40 patients and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in 22 patients. Late potentials were present in 16 of 40 (40%) patients with old infarction but in only 3 of 22 (14%) patients with nonischemic CHF (p = 0.03). Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were obtained in 34 patients (55%). Total ventricular ectopic activity and repetitive forms of ectopy were similar in patients with and without late potentials. Nine patients died suddenly, 9 had nonsudden death, 15 underwent heart transplantation and 29 were alive and well after a mean follow-up of 218 +/- 154 days. At 1 year, the actuarial risk of death was 37% and of sudden death was 20%. Sudden death risk was 12% in patients with late potentials versus 21% in those without (p = 0.73). Thus, the incidence of the arrhythmia substrate producing late potentials depends on the CHF etiology. The signal-averaged electrocardiogram and ambulatory electrocardiogram provide independent information for possible risk assessment in CHF. However, late potentials are poor predictors of sudden death risk when CHF is advanced, possibly due to the heterogeneity of causes of sudden death--ventricular tachycardia being only 1 of many possible mechanisms. 
5	Premature menopause because of an inherited deletion in the long arm of the X-chromosome. A family is described in which both a mother and an infertile daughter had premature menopause at the ages of 31 and 28 years, respectively. Initially, an extensive investigation revealed no apparent cause for their conditions. However, when cytogenetic analysis in the daughter was performed, a terminal deletion in the long arm of one of the X-chromosomes was found. The karyotype was: 46,Xdel(X),(q25-qter). Chromosomal investigation in the mother showed an identical deletion. The karyotype of the patient's 35-year-old sister is normal. She has a normal menstrual cycle and two normal children. The presence of such familial cases suggests that chromosomal investigation should be considered in young women with oligomenorrhea, especially those whose mothers have experienced a premature menopause. 
3	Shunt surgery for hydrocephalus in tuberculous meningitis: a long-term follow-up study. Hydrocephalus is a common complication of tuberculous meningitis. Case studies of 114 patients with tuberculous meningitis and hydrocephalus, who underwent shunt surgery between July, 1975, and June, 1986, were reviewed to evaluate the long-term outcome and to outline a management protocol for these patients based on the results. Seven factors were studied in each case: 1) age at admission; 2) grade on admission (I to IV, classified by the authors; Grade I being the best and Grade IV being the worst); 3) duration of alteration of sensorium; 4) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell content at initial examination; 5) CSF protein levels at initial examination; 6) number of shunt revisions required; and 7) the necessity for bilateral shunts. During a long-term follow-up period ranging from 6 months to 13 years (mean 45.6 months), the mortality rate was 20% for patients in Grade I; 34.7% for patients in Grade II; 51.9% for patients in Grade III; and 100% for patients in Grade IV. Only the grade at the time of admission was found to be statistically significant in determining final outcome (p less than 0.001). Based on these results, the authors advocate early shunt surgery for Grade I and II patients. For patients in Grade III, surgery may be performed either if external ventricular drainage causes an improvement in sensorium or without selection. All patients in Grade IV should undergo external ventricular drainage and only those who show a significant change in their neurological status within 24 to 48 hours of drainage, should have shunt surgery. 
5	Genetic diagnosis of Lynch syndrome II in an extended colorectal cancer-prone family. Knowledge of colon cancer genetics, with particular attention to precision in hereditary cancer syndrome diagnosis, can often enable highly targeted surveillance and management strategies for patients at high genetic risk. Unfortunately, the patient's family history of cancer is often given minimal attention, and knowledge of hereditary cancer syndromes is frequently limited. Indeed, many physicians still consider familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) as the only genetic risk factor for colorectal cancer. This concern with FAP was noted in a colorectal cancer-prone kindred which for decades had been thought to manifest that syndrome. However, after meticulous genetic, medical, and pathologic studies, the cardinal phenotypic characteristics of Lynch syndrome II were observed. The potential for cancer control in current and future generations of families like this one clearly mandates the need for computerized registries which could transmit current information about hereditary colon cancer syndrome diagnosis, surveillance, and management. 
4	Underestimation of treatment effect in crossover trials. In crossover trials each subject serves as his own control. For the study of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and angina pectoria, properly designed crossover studies are preferred to parallel studies. There is a considerable between-subject variability of symptoms in some of these conditions. Bias due to this is eliminated by the use of a crossover design. However, a problem is the so-called treatment-by-period interaction. The present study analyzes the potential influences of this on the outcome of the trial. Physical carryover effect, defined as a physical effect of the first treatment period carrying on into the second, tends to minimize differences between two consecutive treatment periods. So does the frustrating experience of an inactive agent in the first treatment period. Outside influences such as the change of the seasons may affect lengthy crossover trials in a similar way. The author concludes that the treatment effect in a crossover trial tends to be underestimated. The current concept that reports of clinical trials are generally biased toward an exaggeration of treatment effects does not seem to apply to crossover trials. 
3	AAEM case report #1: ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. A patient with bilateral cubital syndrome complicated by anomalous innervation is presented. The electrodiagnostic approach to patients with this neuropathy is reviewed emphasizing new developments. The interpretation of the findings in this patient centers around issues of pathophysiology and methodology. 
1	Intracranial tumor in infants: characteristics, management, and outcome of a contemporary series. Since 1980, 22 patients less than 2 years of age have been treated for intracranial tumors at our institution. The most common presentation was elevated intracranial pressure associated with ventriculomegaly (73%). The diagnosis was made by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging and confirmed surgically in every case. In 68% of cases, the tumor involved midline structures in the central nervous system. Tumors were infratentorial in 29% of patients less than 1 year of age and in 60% of those more than 1 year of age. Most tumors were either primitive neuroectodermal tumors (41%, 7 of 9 located in midline posterior fossa structures) or astrocytomas (27%, 5 of 6 located in the hypothalamus, chiasm, or optic nerve). Twenty patients had gross or subtotal tumor resection. Surgical mortality and neurological morbidity were 10% and 5%, respectively. Of 5 patients who underwent a second operation for tumor recurrence, 3 demonstrated a change in the pathological features of the tumor from those of the original diagnosis. Of 10 surgical survivors with malignant tumors, 8 received chemotherapy and 5 radiation therapy. Radiation was not administered before 1 year of age. The overall 1-year survival was 70%, and 2-year survival was 58%. Two-year survival for benign and malignant tumors was not significantly different. We think that the interdisciplinary efforts directed toward the treatment of these tumors has improved survival and that all children should be offered entry to a research protocol and aggressive treatment. 
3	Aspiration in bilateral stroke patients. Seventy patients with bilateral strokes underwent neurologic and videofluoroscopic barium swallowing examinations; 34 (48.6%) aspirated. Patients with aspiration were more likely to have posterior circulation strokes, abnormal cough, abnormal gag, and dysphonia. However, patients likely to aspirate can be identified best by the presence of an abnormal voluntary cough, an abnormal gag reflex, or both. The prediction of patients at risk for aspiration was not improved by additional clinical information (ie, presence of dysphonia or bilateral neurologic signs). 
3	Prognostic factors in the treatment of alopecia areata with diphenylcyclopropenone. One hundred thirty-nine patients with alopecia areata were treated with diphenylcyclopropenone. Before treatment, 85 patients had subtotal or total hair loss (greater than 90% bald area) and in the remaining patients scalp involvement was between 40% and 90%. The following three factors were found to be of prognostic significance: type of alopecia areata as documented before treatment, duration of the disease before therapy, and presence of nail changes. Other factors such as age at onset, sex, presence of atopic features, the extent of variation in the range of diphenylcyclopropenone concentrations during treatment, and sleep disturbances caused by pruritus did not influence the prognosis significantly. 
5	Characterization of a large deletion associated with a polymorphic block of repeated dinucleotides in the type III procollagen gene (COL3A1) of a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV (EDS IV) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by extreme fragility of skin, blood vessels, intestine, gravid uterus, and lungs. The phenotype is accounted for by mutations affecting the integrity and/or synthesis of the precursor procollagen molecules of type III collagen. In this article, we report the elucidation of the molecular defect in an EDS IV patient whose type III collagen was previously found to be structurally abnormal. We utilized PCR in a two-step process involving first the localization of the mutation in the mRNA and then the characterization of the defect in the gene. The results established the patient's heterozygosity for a genomic deletion of about 7.5 kb which eliminates 1,026 nucleotides of coding sequences in the message. The mutation arose as a result of an exon-to-intron recombination. The deleted segment extends from the 13th nucleotide of exon 9 to within a DNA sequence of intron 24, which is composed of a series of dinucleotide repeats. Using PCR, we tested the polymorphic nature of this DNA element on several unrelated individuals. Analysis of amplified genomic products of 45 chromosomes recognized at least four distinct allelic forms that display frequencies ranging from 5% to 61%. Mendelian segregation of three of the four alleles was established by the same method in a 3-generation family. 
5	Cheilitis granulomatosa: report of six cases and review of the literature. Six cases of cheilitis granulomatosa, a rare inflammatory disorder of unknown origin, are reported. The condition produces nontender, persistent swelling of one or both lips and affects primarily young adults. Histologically, nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation is seen. The clinical findings and results of therapy in these six cases are presented. One patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Plaquenil) that stabilized the process. One of our patients had vesicular-appearing lesions. Microscopic examination showed the lesions to be dilated superficial lymphatic channels, a finding that to our knowledge has not been previously described. 
3	Stereotactic investigation of limbic epilepsy using a multimodal image analysis system. Technical note. A methodology has been developed for stereotactic investigation of limbic epilepsy using an image-analysis system that simultaneously displays different structural and functional images of the brain. The validity and accuracy of this system were established with phantom studies. Surgical planning and electrode implantation are guided by stereotactic magnetic resonance imaging, digital subtraction angiography, and position emission tomography. This methodology provides the spatiotemporal relationship of cerebral structure and function necessary to identify seizure onset and propagation in human limbic system epilepsy. 
5	Does indomethacin alter the hemodynamic response to magnesium sulfate infusion and hemorrhage in gravid ewes? The purpose of this study was to determine whether indomethacin alters the maternal and fetal hemodynamic response to magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) infusion and hemorrhage in gravid ewes. We studied seven chronically instrumented animals between 0.8 and 0.9 of timed gestation. The experimental sequence included: 1) at time 0, indomethacin, 2 mg/kg, or vehicle only intravenously (IV) over 5 minutes; 2) at 60 minutes, MgSO4 4 g IV over 5 minutes; 3) at 65 minutes, MgSO4 infusion at 4 g/hour; 4) at 150 minutes, maternal hemorrhage, 20 mL/kg, over 60 minutes; and 5) at 215 minutes, reinfusion of maternal blood over 60 minutes. Each animal was studied with and without indomethacin. Indomethacin, but not vehicle only, transiently increased maternal and fetal mean arterial pressure (MAP), decreased maternal and fetal heart rate, and decreased maternal cardiac output. Magnesium sulfate significantly decreased uterine vascular resistance and increased uterine blood flow both with and without indomethacin. Hemorrhage significantly decreased maternal MAP, heart rate, cardiac output, and uterine blood flow in both groups. The magnitude of each change was similar between the groups. For example, at the end of hemorrhage, maternal MAP was 36 +/- 7% below baseline (P = .0001) with indomethacin and 41 +/- 2% below baseline (P = .0001) in the vehicle-only group (P = not significant between groups). Hemorrhage significantly decreased fetal heart rate, pH, and PO2, and increased fetal MAP and PCO2 in both groups. We conclude that indomethacin did not alter the maternal or fetal hemodynamic response to MgSO4 infusion and hemorrhage in gravid ewes. 
1	Intracerebral solitary plasmacytoma. We report a rare occurrence of intraparenchymal plasmacytoma and review the literature. The clonal nature of the neoplasm is demonstrated by immunohistochemical and molecular techniques. The importance of the latter techniques in ruling out other pathological entities is stressed. 
3	Excitatory amino acids in the developing brain: ontogeny, plasticity, and excitotoxicity. Besides their role as neurotransmitters, excitatory amino acids (EAAs) in the developing brain are crucially involved in plasticity and excitotoxicity which are modified by their distinct ontogeny. Along with incomplete neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis, presynaptic markers of the EAA system are immature in the developing brain; however, postsynaptic EAA system activities, particularly of the N-methyl-D-aspartate and quisqualate receptors, are transiently enhanced early in life. This transient enhancement is presumably beneficial to the immature brain because physiologic activation of the EAA system plays a critical role in plasticity of early learning and morphogenesis. At the same time, this transient hypersensitivity renders the immature brain vulnerable to pathologic excitation of the EAA system (excitotoxicity) as observed during neonatal hypoxia-ischemia. 
4	Alarm reaction and serum K+ in hypertensive patients. The effect of serum K+ of the alarm reaction induced by the participation to an experimental noninvasive study was evaluated in 35 subjects with borderline hypertension and in 18 essential hypertensives. A group of 44 inpatients undergoing routine blood sampling served as a control. Serum K+, blood pressure and heart rate were measured before (casual) and after (baseline) 20 min of rest in the recumbent position. Baseline serum K+ values were significantly higher than casual values in patients participating to the experimental protocol while no change was observed in inpatients undergoing routine blood sampling. The increase in serum K+ induced by relaxation was significantly related to heart rate decrease (r = 0.73). After relaxation 75% of patients had an increase in serum K+ with a change greater than 10% in about 35% of patients. In a subgroup of patients who repeated the same test three times, the alarm reaction was still evident and not reproducible within each patient. These data suggest that when potassium levels are measured in outpatients undergoing diagnostic or experimental procedures falsely reduced levels can be found in a large proportion of subjects. 
5	Acute myocardial infarction and chest pain syndromes after cocaine use. Seventy patients hospitalized with chest pain after cocaine use were retrospectively evaluated to define the risk and clinical course of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMI developed in 22 patients (31%) and transient myocardial ischemia was seen in an additional 9 patients (13%). Coronary risk factors did not distinguish those who developed AMI from those who did not. The presenting electrocardiogram was abnormal in 20 of 22 patients who evolved AMI and in 19 of 48 of those who did not. Creatine kinase levels were elevated in 75% of the patients, including 65% of those who did not develop AMI, but creatine kinase-MB elevations were only observed in the AMI group. The route of cocaine administration did not predict AMI and there was no predilection for a particular coronary vascular bed. The length of time between drug use and onset of AMI pain was often quite prolonged (median interval, 18 vs 1 hour in the non-AMI group). Eight of the patients with AMI underwent cardiac catheterization and 4 had significant coronary narrowing. 
4	A rheolytic system for percutaneous coronary and peripheral plaque removal. A method for plaque dissolution has been identified that percutaneously delivers a pulsatile high-velocity stream of saline to the site of an atheromatous lesion within a coronary or peripheral artery. In vitro evaluation and in vivo canine and porcine testing were performed using this 'rheolytic' system to determine its feasibility in ablating calcified plaque and soft thrombotic tissue. A prototype rheolytic guidewire capable of providing 30,000 psi of internal pressure was designed to fit within the guidewire lumen of a standard percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty catheter. An additional over-the-wire rheolytic catheter was fabricated to follow a standard .014-inch guidewire. The rheolytic devices were tested in vitro with simulated atheromatous and thrombotic lesions to evaluate the size and quantity of the particulate effluent. The particulate was then sterilized, mixed with saline, and introduced percutaneously into the animal kidney and heart for evaluation. The in vitro studies demonstrated that the rheolytic catheter and guidewire were able to follow both a coronary and femoral arterial model and successfully ablate the simulated lesions. The particle size for osseous, muscular, and cartilagenous tissue ranged from 2 to 6 micrometers; for fresh human plaque the particles ranged from 2 to 15 micrometers. Injection of cartilagenous and plaque particles into the animal model caused very slight regions of necrosis but no clinical sequelae. Applications of the rheolytic devices to the animal femoral artery demonstrated that both devices could ablate and cross calified or soft thrombosed lesions without damage to the vessel wall; the rheolytic catheter provided a debulking of the plaque. 
4	Epidemiology of heart failure. Analysis of 34 years of follow-up of Framingham Study data provides clinically relevant insights into the prevalence, incidence, secular trends, prognosis, and modifiable risk factors for the occurrence of heart failure in a general population sample. Heart failure was found to be highly prevalent, affecting about 1% of persons in their 50s and rising progressively with age to afflict 10% of persons in their 80s. The annual incidence also increased with age, from about 0.2% in persons 45 to 54 years, to 4.0% in men 85 to 94 years, with the incidence approximately doubling with each decade of age. Women lagged slightly behind men in incidence at all ages. Male predominance was because of a higher rate of coronary heart disease, which confers a fourfold increased risk of heart failure. Heart failure, once manifest, was highly lethal, with 37% of men and 33% of women dying within 2 years of diagnosis. The 6-year mortality rate was 82% for men and 67% for women, which corresponded to a death rate fourfold to eightfold greater than that of the general population of the same age. Sudden death was a common mode of exitus and accounted for 28% of the cardiovascular deaths in men and 14% in women with heart failure. Hypertension and coronary disease were the predominant causes for heart failure and accounted for more than 80% of all clinical events. Factors reflecting deteriorating cardiac function were associated with a substantial increase in risk of overt heart failure. These include low vital capacity, sinus tachycardia, and ECG evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. 
3	Ubiquitin immunoreactivity in kuru plaques in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Cerebellar kuru plaques in 2 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were studied immunohistochemically. Similar to cerebellar senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease, many kuru plaques contained ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative small granular elements, presumably representing dystrophic neurites. Our results suggest that similar mechanisms are involved in neuritic changes in cerebellar plaques in Creutzfeldt-Jakob and Alzheimer's diseases despite differences of amyloid proteins in the plaques. 
1	Prognostic value of c-myc proto-oncogene overexpression in early invasive carcinoma of the cervix. The prognostic effect of c-myc oncogene overexpression was assessed in a multivariate analysis of 93 patients with invasive carcinoma of the cervix, stage Ib, IIa, and IIb proximal. The treatment was based on the association of brachytherapy-colpohysterectomy and lymphadenectomy. Analysis of c-myc gene expression was done using Northern and slot blot hybridization techniques. Overexpression of c-myc (ie, levels at least three times the mean observed in normal tissues) was present in 33% of the tumors. The proportion of carcinomas with c-myc overexpression significantly increased with the size of the primary tumor (P = .04). No relationship was found between c-myc overexpression and the other clinical and histologic parameters, including the nodal status. The relative risk of relapse (overall, pelvic failure, distant metastases) was analyzed in a Cox's proportional hazards model. Three factors were significantly related to the risk of overall relapse when the multivariate analysis was performed, namely, the tumor size, the nodal status, and c-myc expression. A combination of c-myc expression and the nodal status provided a very accurate indication of the risk of relapse. Indeed, patients with negative nodes had a 3-year disease-free survival rate of 93% (95% confidence interval [Cl], 79% to 98%) when c-myc was expressed at a normal level, whereas this rate was only 51% (95% Cl, 26% to 63%) when c-myc was overexpressed (log-rank test, P = .02). In addition, in the subgroup of patients with positive nodes, this rate was 44% (95% Cl, 25% to 77%) and 15% (95% Cl, 4% to 49%) when c-myc gene was expressed at normal level, or overexpressed, respectively. Finally, c-myc gene overexpression was, in the multivariate analysis, the first factor selected by the model regarding the risk of distant metastases. 
1	Intraperitoneal lymphokine-activated killer-cell and interleukin-2 therapy for malignancies limited to the peritoneal cavity. Autologous lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and recombinant human interleukin-2 (rIL-2) were administered intraperitoneally (IP) to 24 patients with malignancies limited to the peritoneal space. Ten patients had ovarian cancer, 12 had colorectal cancer, and one patient each had endometrial carcinoma and primary small-bowel adenocarcinoma. All ovarian cancer patients, three of twelve colorectal cancer patients, and one patient with endometrial carcinoma had received prior therapy. Patients received IL-2 100,000 U/kg every 8 hours intravenously (IV) for 3 days, and 2 days later underwent daily leukapheresis for 5 days. LAK cells were generated in vitro by incubating the peripheral blood mononuclear cells in IL-2 for 7 days and were then administered IP daily for 5 days through a Tenckhoff catheter (Davol, Inc, Cranston, RI) together with IL-2 25,000 U/kg IP every 8 hours. All but one patient completed at least one cycle of therapy. Toxic side effects included minor to moderate hypotension, fever, chills, rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and distension, diarrhea, oliguria, fluid retention, thrombocytopenia, and minor elevations of liver function tests; all of these rapidly improved after discontinuation of IL-2. One patient had a grand mal seizure, and one suffered a colonic perforation; these were felt to be treatment-related. IP fibrosis developed in 14 patients and limited repeated cyclic administration of this therapy in five patients. Two of 10 (20%) ovarian cancer patients and five of 12 (42%) colorectal cancer patients had laparoscopy- or laparotomy-documented partial responses. We conclude that LAK cells and rIL-2 can be administered IP to cancer patients, resulting in moderate to severe short-term toxicity and modest therapeutic efficacy. Further investigation of this form of adoptive immunotherapy modified to address the problem of IP fibrosis and with lower IP IL-2 doses is justified by these initial results. 
2	Carcinoma of the gallbladder. Gallbladder cancer remains difficult to diagnose preoperatively. However, recent work suggests that ultrasound may be effective. Gallbladder cancer remains highly lethal despite aggressive therapy. Extension of the disease beyond the mucosa predicts a poor chance of long-term survival. 
4	Microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism causing subacute cor pulmonale: a difficult antemortem diagnosis [published erratum appears in Mayo Clin Proc 1991 Apr;66(4):439] Microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism is difficult to diagnose. The most common initial clinical symptom is subacute progressive dyspnea, and the initial laboratory evaluation typically shows hypoxemia in a patient with clear lung fields on a chest roentgenogram. Another distinguishing feature may be hepatic abnormalities. In general, pulmonary angiography discloses no evidence of emboli, but multiple subsegmental peripheral perfusion defects are noted on ventilation-perfusion lung scans. The diagnosis of microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism can be confirmed by open-lung or transbronchial lung biopsy or by microvascular pulmonary cytology, a less invasive procedure that could be performed at the time of pulmonary angiography. Herein we describe two patients with unsuspected microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism that eventuated in subacute cor pulmonale and death. These cases illustrate the characteristic findings of this entity and emphasize the need for early diagnosis. 
5	Obstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous return. Toward neutralization of a major risk factor. Among 57 neonates undergoing repair of total anomalous pulmonary venous return with severe pulmonary venous obstruction from 1980 through 1989, date of operation (1980 to 1984), preoperative hemodynamic instability, and failure to monitor pulmonary artery pressure postoperatively were risk factors for death. Thus, among the 30 patients having repair between 1985 and 1989, the 55-month survival rate including hospital deaths was 83%. 
4	The association between Type A behavior and change in coronary risk factors among young adults. The association of Type A/B behavior pattern and changes in blood pressure, total serum cholesterol, serum triglyceride, body mass, and smoking was estimated in a cohort of 375 young Black and White men and women from a rural county in Central Kentucky between 1978-79 and 1985-88. Type A participants experienced significant increases in systolic (2.90 +/- 1.29 mmHg) and diastolic (3.80 +/- 1.17 mmHg) blood pressure and in cigarette smoking (3.26 +/- 0.89 cigarettes per day) over the eight-year follow-up period, but Type B participants experienced no change. Type A and B individuals showed similar changes in total serum cholesterol, serum triglyceride, or body mass. Differences between behavioral types in blood pressure were present for women but not men, and for Blacks but not for Whites. These findings suggest a possible significance of the Type A pattern for the development of cardiovascular risk of young adults. 
5	Is liver transplantation justified for the treatment of hepatic malignancies? Twenty-eight patients received orthotopic liver transplants for malignant disease between February 1, 1984, and December 31, 1989. Preoperative diagnoses included hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 16), cholangiocarcinoma (n = 3), other primary hepatic tumors (n = 6), and metastatic diseases to the liver (n = 3). Overall actuarial survivals at 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years were 67.3%, 51%, and 31%, respectively. Long-term survival longer than 5 years was achieved in 3 patients. The recurrence rate in patients surviving longer than 3 months is 48% (median, 7 months). Hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma had the poorest survival and highest recurrence rates. Specific prognostic factors correlating with survival or recurrence could not be elucidated. These results indicate that orthotopic liver transplants can provide long-term cure and palliation for malignant disease; however, patient selection is extremely important in predicting outcome. 
2	A chronic granulomatous syndrome of unknown origin. A small clinically distinct group of patients with widespread tissue granulomata are described. The principal presenting symptoms are malaise, fever, and weight loss, although a wide variety of complaints are documented. Pulmonary involvement is uncommon. The granulomata are noncaseating with a few multinucleate giant cells and some surrounding chronic inflammatory infiltrate. There is no evidence of an associated arteritis. The disease has a relapsing and remitting course and although it may require treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, particularly if the kidneys are involved, the prognosis is relatively good. We propose that this entity be called granulomatous syndrome of unknown origin. The characteristics that set this syndrome apart from the other granulomatous vasculitides are discussed. The current limited understanding of granuloma formation does not allow us to propose a definite etiology for this condition. It is emphasized that it is not helpful to encompass it within a label of sarcoidosis. First, it may only serve to confuse the doctor in assessing and treating this very particular group of patients. Secondly, it may hinder future attempts to understand the different pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the various conditions in which granulomata may arise. 
1	Removal of large symptomatic intrauterine growths by the hysteroscopic resectoscope. Fifty-three patients underwent 55 procedures with a resectoscope for the removal of large symptomatic intrauterine growths. The presenting complaint was menorrhagia, menometrorrhagia, or heavy postmenopausal bleeding in 38 patients; excessive menses plus infertility in 13 patients; and infertility alone in two patients. Forty-three patients had pedunculated or sessile submucous myomas and ten patients had large endometrial polyps. The long-term results are based on 45 patients followed for longer than 1 year. Excessive bleeding was controlled in 40 of the 43 women (93%). Failure to control abnormal bleeding was apparent within the first year. Seven of the 12 infertility patients (58%) delivered live-born infants. Five patients have undergone subsequent hysterectomies (9%). Two patients had repeat resectoscopic removal of myomas and two had subsequent non-resectoscope myomectomies. No major complications were encountered. 
3	Apneic oxygenation in apnea tests for brain death. A controlled trial. We performed a prospective controlled study of apneic oxygenation on 15 patients undergoing apnea tests for brain death. All patients were preoxygenated with 100% oxygen at existing respirator settings. During the 10-minute apnea tests, nine patients were given continuous apneic oxygenation by tracheal cannula. The other six patients had tracheal tubes open to room air. The patients given apneic oxygenation had little or no hypoxia by the end of the test. The patients given room air during the test became hypoxic. Many neurologists perform apnea tests with no oxygenation or with preoxygenation alone. This is the first prospective controlled study (to our knowledge) of apneic oxygenation; it shows that preoxygenation alone does not prevent hypoxia during apnea tests for brain death. We recommend that all apnea tests be performed with apneic oxygenation. 
1	Therapeutic dilemmas associated with antenatally detected ovarian cysts. Fifteen instances of ovarian cysts detected antenatally are reported. Seven cysts more than 5 centimeters in diameter were treated surgically because of clinical signs, such as palpable abdominal mass, vomiting and abdominal distension. Seven cysts less than 5 centimeters in diameter, and one cyst more than 5 centimeters in diameter began to regress spontaneously within six months after birth. Because the pathophysiologic nature of neonatal ovarian cysts has not been elucidated and because the borderline between physiologic and pathologic factors is still unclear, we propose a more conservative approach in the management of neonatal ovarian cysts to avoid unnecessary operations. 
2	Hyposensitivity to vasopressin in patients with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis during acute variceal hemorrhage. It has been suggested that vasopressin given during hemorrhage may be less effective than when given during a stable state in a portal-hypertensive rat model. This study was designed to evaluate the hemodynamic response to vasopressin infusion in 25 HBsAg-positive cirrhotic patients. Nine patients had active variceal hemorrhage before vasopressin infusion, and the other 16 patients were in a stable condition at the time of infusion. The two groups of patients were similar in baseline values except that a higher heart rate was found in patients with hemorrhage (96 +/- 20 vs. 73 +/- 10 beats/min, mean +/- S.D., p less than 0.01). Thirty minutes after vasopressin infusion (0.66 units/min), hepatic venous pressure gradient significantly decreased in both bleeding and stable patients (from 21 +/- 9 to 18 +/- 9 mm Hg, p less than 0.05; and from 18 +/- 4 to 8 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001, respectively). However, the decrease of hepatic venous pressure gradient was less obvious in bleeding patients as compared with stable patients (4 +/- 3 vs. 9 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001). A significant reduction of hepatic venous pressure gradient after vasopressin infusion was found in five bleeding patients without shock (from a median of 16 mm Hg [range = 12 to 26] to 11 mm Hg [range = 6 to 18], p less than 0.05), but not in four bleeding patients with shock (from 28 [range = 15 to 36] to 25 [range = 18 to 33] mm Hg, p greater than 0.05). 
5	Seismic communication in a blind subterranean mammal: a major somatosensory mechanism in adaptive evolution underground. Seismic communication, through low-frequency and patterned substrate-borne vibrations that are generated by head thumping, and which travel long distances underground, is important in the nonvisual communication of subterranean mole rats of the Spalax ehrenbergi superspecies (2n = 52, 54, 58, and 60) in Israel. This importance pertains both intraspecifically in adaptation and interspecifically in speciation. Neurophysiologic, behavioral, and anatomic findings in this study suggest that the mechanism of long-distance seismic communication is basically somatosensory and is independent of the auditory mechanism. Seismic communication thus appears to be a channel of communication important in the evolution of subterranean mammals that display major adaptation to life underground. 
5	Age effects susceptibility to pulmonary barotrauma in rabbits. OBJECTIVE: We studied the effect of age on the development of pulmonary barotrauma after mechanical ventilation with high peak inspiratory pressures (PIP). DESIGN: Young (4 to 6 wk old) and adult rabbits were ventilated for 1 hr at PIPs of 15, 30, and either 45 cm H2O (young group) or 55 cm H2O (adult group). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The pulmonary capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,c) was measured in an isolated lung perfusion system after the animals were killed. In young rabbits, Kf,c increased significantly from the 15 cm H2O PIP value in both the 30 cm H2O (55%) and 45 cm H2O (507%) PIP groups, whereas Kf,c was increased in adult rabbits only in the 55 cm H2O (113%) PIP group. Kf,c was significantly (p less than .01) higher in young rabbits than in adult rabbits after ventilation, with every level of PIP being 91% higher at 15 cm H2O PIP and 440% higher at 45 to 55 cm H2O PIP. Also, a greater incidence of pneumothorax and airleaks was observed in the young rabbits. Pressure-volume loops demonstrated that the young rabbits had more compliant lungs and chest wall than adult rabbits. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the lungs of young rabbits had a higher baseline microvascular permeability and were more susceptible to the development of ventilator-induced increased microvascular permeability. More compliant lungs and chest wall and the larger distending volumes attained at each peak airway pressure appear to be the mechanisms. 
5	Pulmonary hypertension five years after left pneumonectomy for adenoid cystic carcinoma. We report the findings in a patient with shortness of breath due to pulmonary hypertension five years after left pneumonectomy. Mediastinal recurrence of an incompletely resected and slowly growing adenoid cystic carcinoma of the left main bronchus had encased the right main pulmonary artery. 
4	Effect of Bay U 3405, a new thromboxane antagonist, on collagen-induced thromboembolism in rabbits. Bay U 3405 [(3R)-3-(4-fluorophenylsulfonamido)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9- carbazolepropanoic acid] potently inhibits platelet aggregation, thromboxane A2-induced contraction of smooth muscles, and coronary artery thrombosis. We have previously demonstrated inhibition of arachidonic acid-induced sudden death by Bay U 3405. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Bay U 3405 on thromboembolism provoked by collagen. Collagen fibrils dissolved in an isotonic glucose solution were injected into a marginal ear vein of anesthetized rabbits. Sudden death occurred within a few minutes due to elevated thromboxane A2 levels causing intravascular platelet aggregation and myocardial ischemia. In the vehicle-treated group, 100% of the animals died. One of the most prominent parameters was the massive fall in blood pressure. All animals pretreated with 10 mg/kg orally Bay U 3405 survived, showing only a transient hypotensive effect. Tracings of the electrocardiogram and heart rate were unchanged. Bay U 3405 will therefore be useful to elucidate the role of thromboxane A2 in various cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. 
1	Gastric duplication cyst communicating with the pancreatic duct: a rare cause of recurrent abdominal pain. A 41-year-old woman with recurrent attacks of postprandial abdominal pain was found on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and subsequent computed tomographic scan to have an enteric duplication within the substance of the pancreas with communication to the pancreatic duct. Celiotomy demonstrated a noncontiguous gastric duplication cyst. Internal drainage was curative. 
5	Recurrent herpes gestationis with postpartum flare: a case report. A case of herpes gestationis recurring in each pregnancy, with a postpartum flare-up in the last pregnancy, is described. The diagnosis was confirmed by skin biopsy. The first pregnancy ended in a term stillbirth, but there were favorable outcomes in four subsequent pregnancies. Histopathologic examination of the placentas of the last three pregnancies revealed varying grades of villositis. Symptoms improved with oral corticosteroids. 
5	Clinical efficacy of oral-transdermal clonidine combinations during the perioperative period. In an attempt to maintain stable levels of an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist throughout the perioperative period, two different oral-transdermal clonidine dosage regimens were administered according to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. We determined the clinical efficacy of a high- and a low-dose clonidine regimen on sedation, hemodynamic parameters, anesthesia, and analgesia. The low-dose clonidine group of patients (n = 14) received a 7-cm2 clonidine transdermal patch (Catapres-TTS #2), which was supplemented with oral doses of clonidine approximately 3 micrograms.kg-1 on the evening prior to surgery and on the morning of surgery. The high-dose clonidine group (n = 14) received a 10.5-cm2 clonidine transdermal patch (Catapres-TTS #3) with oral clonidine approximately 4.5 micrograms.kg-1 at bedtime and 6.0 micrograms.kg-1 on the morning of surgery. Placebo-treated (control) patients received the same occlusive patch without active ingredient and oral placebo tablets at bedtime and on the morning of surgery. Preanesthetic medication included midazolam 50 micrograms.kg-1 intramuscularly (im). Anesthesia was induced with alfentanil 30 micrograms.kg-1 intravenously (iv), thiopental 3 mg.kg-1 iv, and vecuronium 0.1 mg.kg-1 iv, and was maintained with 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen and a continuous infusion of alfentanil 0.5 microgram.kg-1.min-1. Isoflurane was added when the blood pressure exceeded 110% of the patient's prestudy value. For pain relief postoperatively, the patients received morphine, 1-2-mg iv boluses, via a patient-controlled analgesia pump. The low-dose clonidine patient group had mean plasma clonidine concentrations that varied from 1.47 ng.ml-1 (preoperative) to 1.32 ng.ml-1 (postoperative day 2). 
3	Richner-Hanhart's syndrome. Electron microscopic study of the skin lesion. The plantar hyperkeratotic skin lesion in a case of Richner-Hanhart's syndrome was investigated using ultrastructural examination. Light microscopic examination showed remarkable hyperkeratosis and some aberrant keratinocytes with multiple nuclei. On ultrastructural examination, some abnormal structures were seen in the affected keratinocytes: aggregations of tonofilaments and intracytoplasmic inclusions. The inclusions were needle shaped and were considered to be "crystal ghosts," presumably of tyrosine. The formation of tyrosine crystalline inclusions seems to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of the cutaneous lesions in Richner-Hanhart's syndrome. 
2	Frequency of recovery of Blastocystis hominis in clinical practice. We examined the frequency of isolation of Blastocystis hominis from stools of patients seen in an indigent-care teaching hospital. Over a 2-year period, 2,744 stool specimens were examined prospectively. B. hominis was found in 262 stools (9.5% of all stool specimens and 53.5% of the positive specimens). Clinical data were obtained from 80 patients with stools positive for B. hominis. B. hominis was the only parasite isolated in 39 of 47 (83%) of the adults, compared with 17 of 33 (52%) of the children (p = 0.006). All but 2 of 52 patients without concomitant parasitic infection or bacterial pathogens in stool had gastrointestinal symptoms (41 abdominal pain, 26 diarrhea, and 5 vomiting), but no association was seen with fever, peripheral leukocytosis, stool occult blood, fecal leukocytes, or endoscopic or radiologic evidence of colitis. Therefore, B. hominis was frequently recovered from stools examined in a hospital clinical parasitology laboratory. The clinical presentations of patients in our series did not suggest that B. hominis was invasive. Most patients with B. hominis probably do not require treatment since they will either have spontaneous resolution of symptoms or will be found to have an alternative explanation for their problem. 
4	Lipoprotein (a) and coronary heart disease: a prospective case-control study in a general population sample of middle aged men. OBJECTIVE--To examine the association between the serum lipoprotein (a) concentration and subsequent coronary heart disease. DESIGN--Prospective case-control study based on a six year follow up of a general population sample of men aged 50 at baseline in 1983-4. Serum samples were frozen at the time of the baseline examination and kept at -70 degrees C for six years, after which the lipoprotein (a) concentrations in the samples were measured in cases and controls. SETTING--City of Gothenburg, Sweden. SUBJECTS--26 Men, from a general population sample of 776 men, who had sustained a myocardial infarction or died of coronary heart disease during the six years and 109 randomly selected controls from the same sample who had remained free of myocardial infarction. In neither cases nor controls was there a history of myocardial infarction at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Proportion of myocardial infarction or deaths from coronary heart disease, or both, in relation to the serum lipoprotein (a) concentration. RESULTS--Men who suffered coronary heart disease had significantly higher serum lipoprotein (a) concentrations than controls (mean difference 105 mg/l; 95% confidence interval 18 to 192 mg/l). Men with the highest fifth of serum lipoprotein (a) concentrations (cut off point 365 mg/l) suffered a coronary heart disease rate which was more than twice that of men with the lowest four fifths of concentrations. Logistic regression analysis showed the serum lipoprotein (a) concentration to be significantly associated with coronary heart disease independently of other risk factors. CONCLUSION--The serum lipoprotein (a) concentration in middle aged men is an independent risk factor for subsequent myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease. 
1	Primary carcinoma of the upper urinary tract. Effect of primary and secondary therapy on survival. The pathologic material and medical records of 76 patients with primary upper urinary tract carcinomas were reviewed to identify the role of grade and stage in predicting survival; to determine any differences in survival between ureteral and renal pelvic carcinoma; to understand the role of local therapy in low grade, low stage tumors; and to establish the usefulness of adjuvant therapies in metastatic disease. Kaplan-Meier survival curves with Cox-Mantel analysis for statistical significance revealed both grade and stage to be excellent predictors of survival. No differences in survival were noted between renal pelvic and ureteral carcinomas for equivalent stage tumors. For low grade, low stage tumors, although there was an increased risk of local recurrence with local therapy, there were no differences in survival between patients treated with local therapy or radical surgery. Finally, cisplatin-based chemotherapy seemed to improve survival in patients with metastatic disease. 
5	Drop attacks with Meniere's syndrome. We report the clinical features of 12 patients with drop attacks associated with Meniere's syndrome. Each described a sensation of being pushed, thrown, or knocked to the ground or a sudden illusion of movement of the environment that led to a fall. These episodes were not accompanied by symptoms of their typical attacks of Meniere's syndrome. The drop attacks occurred early and late in the course of the disease; they were the initial manifestation in 1 patient. In the majority the episodes spontaneously remitted, although Meniere's syndrome continued to progress. These attacks probably result from a sudden mechanical deformation of the otolithic membrane of the utricle or saccule due to pressure gradients within the inner ear. They are important to recognize because their prognosis is relatively benign compared to other causes of drop attacks. 
1	The oncologic risks of skin preservation at mastectomy when combined with immediate reconstruction of the breast. Most oncologic surgeons agree that removal of the nipple, the areola and any recent scar at the site of the biopsy is necessary during a mastectomy for treatment of carcinoma of the breast. There is less agreement about what should be done with the remaining uninvolved mammary skin. Its preservation facilitates the performance of immediate reconstruction of the breast and can lead to improved aesthetic results, but many oncologists fear that this practice could lead to an increased incidence of local tumor recurrence. To determine if that fear was justified, 87 patients who had undergone unilateral or bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction for treatment of early carcinoma of the breast were studied. Preservation of uninvolved skin was used in all instances. All patients had a documented follow-up study of 12 months or more; the average follow-up time was 23.1 months. One peripheral local recurrence was observed. This 1.2 per cent rate of early local recurrence is lower than that reported from several series using modified radical mastectomy without skin preservation or immediate reconstruction, and suggests that skin preservation does not confer additional risks of local recurrence of carcinoma of the breast in properly selected patients. 
3	Thrombocytosis after pneumonia with empyema and other bacterial infections in children. Thrombocytosis is seen in association with many conditions, including infectious diseases. We studied thrombocytosis after severe bacterial infections, particularly pneumonia with empyema in children. A systematic survey of the phenomenon was conducted. Twenty-seven children admitted for pneumonia with empyema were studied. Thrombocytosis (platelet counts greater than 500 x 10(3)/microliters) was present in 92.5%. Platelet counts reached their maximum at 15.1 +/- 3.7 days (range, 7 to 25) and declined to normal after 3 weeks of illness. Compared with a healthy control group, significant thrombocytosis, but of lower incidence, was also noted in children with lobar pneumonia without pleural effusion, bacterial meningitis and osteomyelitis. Platelet functions were examined in seven of the children but no abnormalities were observed. Bone marrow aspiration of three children with pneumonia and empyema showed megakaryocytic hyperplasia. We found no correlation between thrombocytosis, neutrophilia, fever, the clinical course, complications, prognosis or treatment. Neither thromboembolic nor hemorrhagic phenomena were observed. 
4	Discrepancies in the measurement of isovolumic relaxation time: a study comparing M mode and Doppler echocardiography. Mitral valve cusp separation on M mode echogram, the mitral valve opening artefact, and the onset of forward transmitral flow recorded by Doppler echocardiography have all been taken to mark the end of isovolumic relaxation, while its onset has been taken either as the aortic closure sound (A2) recorded phonocardiographically or the aortic closure artefact determined by Doppler technique. Possible differences in the measurement of the isovolumic relaxation time were studied when these landmarks were used in 44 healthy people, 14 patients with mitral stenosis, 21 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, and 24 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy by recording M mode echograms of the mitral valve, and pulsed and continuous wave Doppler spectra of transmitral flow, with simultaneous electrocardiograms and phonocardiograms. A2 was effectively synchronous with the aortic artefact. However, when the onset of Doppler flow was regarded as the end of isovolumic relaxation, the interval was significantly longer than when mitral cusp separation on M mode echograms was used: by 25 (10) ms in healthy individuals, by 25 (15) ms in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, and by 50 (35) ms in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. In patients with mitral stenosis the interval was only 5 (5) ms longer. The mitral valve opening artefact consistently followed the onset of flow and corresponded much more closely to the E point on the M mode echogram. This shows that it occurred during the rapid filling period and well beyond isovolumic relaxation by any definition. Thus isovolumic relaxation time measured from A2 to the onset of transmitral flow or the mitral valve opening artefact differs from that derived from A2 to mitral valve cusp separation. These intervals cannot be used interchangeably to measure "isovolumic relaxation time". 
1	Reviewing the unicystic ameloblastoma: report of two cases. Classification of ameloblastoma into solid, multicystic, unicystic, and peripheral types based on clinical appearance and effects has gained recent recognition. The unicystic ameloblastoma is a less encountered variant of the ameloblastoma. It appears more frequently in the second or third decade with no sexual or racial predilection. It is almost exclusively encountered asymptomatically in the posterior mandible. The following report of two cases discusses the pathophysiology, demographics, histology, and prognosis of the unicystic ameloblastoma. 
1	Radical prostatectomy and adjuvant radioactive gold seed placement: results of treatment at 5 and 10 years for clinical stages A2, B1 and B2 cancer of the prostate. Between 1977 and 1988, 131 patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate underwent combined radical prostatectomy and intraoperative radioactive gold seed placement. Of these 131 patients 80 were clinically assessed as having stage A2 (12), B1 (43) or B2 (25) cancer and they are the subject of this review. The average dose of radioactivity administered to each patient was 96.6 mCi, and mean followup was 65 months (median 64 months). No patient in this series received any other form of adjuvant therapy until disease recurrence was demonstrated. Local recurrences were observed in 2 patients (2.5%) in this series while distant recurrences were observed in 10 (12.5%). Cancer specific survival free of disease at 5 years was 100% for clinical stage A2, 91% for B1 and 75% for B2 cancers. The 10-year survival free of disease was 100% for clinical stage A2, 82% for B1 and 68% for B2 cancers. Covariants of clinical stage and seminal vesicle involvement influenced survival free of disease in a statistically significant manner (p less than 0.05) while pathological stage and degree of tumor differentiation did not. Mild to severe complications were observed in 12 patients (15%). Intraoperative placement of radioactive gold seeds into unresected pelvic tissues surrounding the site of prostatectomy offers a theoretical advantage in treatment by delivering tumoricidal levels of irradiation to residual foci of cancer not appreciated at the time of surgery. Our results suggest that increases in cancer specific survival free of disease over that previously reported for prostatectomy alone may be achieved through this combined treatment regimen. Furthermore, it is our opinion that therapeutic gains can be achieved without the attendant increases in morbidity and treatment delay often associated with adjuvant external beam radiotherapy. 
2	Postoperative pancreatic abscess due to Plesiomonas shigelloides. Plesiomonas shigelloides is being recognized with increasing frequency as a human pathogen. The organism is ubiquitous in fresh and brackish water, and clinical illness has been associated with foreign travel and ingestion of inadequately cooked seafood. We describe a 64-year-old Filipino woman who presented 2 weeks after elective cholecystectomy and pancreatic biopsy with left upper quadrant pain, abdominal distention, and fever. Computerized tomography of the abdomen revealed an abscess in the tail of the pancreas with fluid accumulation in the lesser omental sac. Percutaneous aspiration yielded purulent material, and P. shigelloides was recovered in pure culture. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pancreatic abscess due to P. shigelloides. 
5	Rhodopsin mutants that bind but fail to activate transducin. Rhodopsin is a member of a family of receptors that contain seven transmembrane helices and are coupled to G proteins. The nature of the interactions between rhodopsin mutants and the G protein, transduction (Gt), was investigated by flash photolysis in order to monitor directly Gt binding and dissociation. Three mutant opsins with alterations in their cytoplasmic loops bound 11-cis-retinal to yield pigments with native rhodopsin absorption spectra, but they failed to stimulate the guanosine triphosphatase activity of Gt. The opsin mutations included reversal of a charged pair conserved in all G protein-coupled receptors at the cytoplasmic border of the third transmembrane helix (mutant CD1), replacement of 13 amino acids in the second cytoplasmic loop (mutant CD2), and deletion of 13 amino acids from the third cytoplasmic loop (mutant EF1). Whereas mutant CD1 failed to bind Gt, mutants CD2 and EF1 showed normal Gt binding but failed to release Gt in the presence of guanosine triphosphate. Therefore, it appears that at least the second and third cytoplasmic loops of rhodopsin are required for activation of bound Gt. 
1	Mesangial cell accessory functions: mediation by intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Mesangial cell (MC) proliferation is an early pathologic alteration characteristic of many forms of immune mediated glomerulonephritis. The intracapillary position, contractile capacity, and production of cytokines and other inflammatory molecules place MC in a pivotal position to initiate, mediate, and direct glomerular damage. We as well as others have noted increased levels of cytokines including IFN gamma, TNF, and IL-1 and the cell surface MHC class II and ICAM-1 molecules in the kidneys of mice with lupus nephritis. MHC class II and ICAM-1 molecules are central to the interaction of T cells with antigen presenting cells (APC). Since cytokines can increase both MHC class II and ICAM-1 molecules, we investigated whether mesangial cells could function as APC or accessory cells after cytokine stimulation. For these studies we established a permanent MC line through transformation with origin-deficient SV40 DNA. Surface expression of ICAM-1 was similar in untransformed MC as well as SV40 transformed MC from normal mice and in untransformed cells from mice with lupus nephritis. Basal expression of ICAM-1 was upregulated rapidly by IFN gamma, TNF, and IL-1. MHC class II expression could not be induced with TNF or IL-1 alone but required prolonged stimulation with IFN gamma. MC adhered and presented antigen to an antigen specific IaK restricted T cell hybridoma. Anti-ICAM-1 mAb decreased adhesion and antigen presentation of cytokine stimulated MC. By comparison, MHC class II mAb abrogated antigen presentation by MC bearing MHC class II but did not block adhesion. 
2	A prospective analysis of 1518 laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The Southern Surgeons Club. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The Southern Surgeons Club conducted a prospective study of 1518 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for treatment of gallbladder disease in order to evaluate the safety of this procedure. RESULTS. Seven hundred fifty-eight operations (49.9 percent) were performed at academic hospitals, and 760 (50.1 percent) at private hospitals. In 72 patients (4.7 percent) the operation was converted to conventional open cholecystectomy; the most common reason for the change was the inability to identify the anatomy of the gallbladder as a result of inflammation in the region of this organ. A total of 82 complications occurred in 78 (5.1 percent) of the patients; this is comparable with the rates of 6 to 21 percent that have been reported for conventional cholecystectomy. Overall, the most common complication was superficial infection of the site of insertion of the umbilical trocar. A total of seven injuries to the common bile duct or the hepatic duct occurred during the operation, for a rate of 0.5 percent. Four of the seven injuries were simple lacerations, which were repaired after conversion to conventional cholecystectomy. The incidence of bile-duct injury in the first 13 patients operated on by each surgical group was 2.2 percent, as compared with 0.1 percent for subsequent patients. No complications were attributed directly to either cautery or laser-surgical technique, and similar numbers of complications occurred in academic and private hospitals. The mean hospital stay for the entire group was 1.2 days (range, 6 hours to 30 days). CONCLUSIONS. The results of laparoscopic cholecystectomy compare favorably with those of conventional cholecystectomy with respect to mortality, complications, and length of hospital stay. A slightly higher incidence of biliary injury with the laparoscopic procedure is probably offset by the low incidence of other complications. 
1	Percutaneous fine-needle aspiration cytologic study of main pancreatic duct stenosis under pancreatographic guidance. When pancreatography shows a stenosis of the main pancreatic duct in patients with normal or inconclusive ultrasound and computed tomography, the exact nature of such stenosis is sometimes difficult to precise before surgical exploration. In such cases, the authors systematically performed a percutaneous fine-needle aspiration cytologic study of the stenosis under pancreatographic guidance. Fifteen patients were referred because of suspected pancreatic malignancy. The tumor markers, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 were normal in 11 patients and elevated in one patient, whereas only CA 19-9 was elevated in three others. In 14 cases, both the ultrasound and computed tomography did not show any obvious pancreatic mass. The pancreatography was done through endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (12 patients) or percutaneously in case of failure at ERCP3 and showed a main pancreatic duct stenosis that underwent aspiration by percutaneous fine needle precisely positioned using biplane fluoroscopy. The aspirated material was then smeared on glass slides, air-dried, and stained by Giemsa. In nine of the 15 patients, cytologic study revealed adenocarcinoma. This was confirmed by surgery in five and by progressive deterioration followed by death in four. In six patients, cytologic study gave a nonmalignant result. Chronic pancreatitis was found in five of them, confirmed at surgery in three and based on uneventful follow-up of at least 12 months in two others. In one case, a pancreatic adenocarcinoma not detected by cytologic study was found at surgery. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of this diagnostic approach were 90% and 100%, respectively. No serious complication was noticed. The authors conclude that when ultrasound and computed tomography are inconclusive, percutaneous fine-needle aspiration cytologic study of main pancreatic duct stenosis under pancreatographic guidance is a safe, simple, and helpful procedure in the investigation of patients with suspected pancreatic malignancy. 
5	Allograft tympanoplasty: predictive value of preoperative status. The functional and anatomical results of a series of 181 consecutive allograft tympanoplasties for ears with drum perforation and an intact ossicular chain were retrospectively reviewed and related to preoperative factors. Drum closure was realized in 92% (166 of 181 cases evaluated 1 year after surgery), and 96.6% of the reconstructed drums were still intact 3 years after surgery (118 cases evaluated). An air-bone gap of less than 21 dB was reached in 79.6% (of a total of 162 cases) 1 year after surgery, and in 78% (of a total of 118 cases) 3 years after surgery. Age, contralateral pathology, the wet or dry status of the ear preoperatively, and the preoperative air-bone gap had no influence on anatomical results. The preoperative air-bone gap did not predict the postoperative air-bone gap. The influence of age and existence of contralateral pathology on hearing gain was only visible in some of the strictly defined patient groups. The wet preoperative status of the ear generally predicted lower functional gain. 
3	Intrathecal baclofen for spasticity in cerebral palsy Seventeen patients with congenital spastic cerebral palsy and six patients with other forms of spasticity were injected intrathecally with doses of placebo or baclofen, 25 micrograms, 50 micrograms, or 100 micrograms, in a randomized, double-blind manner. Muscle tone in the upper and lower extremities was assessed by Ashworth scores both before the injections and every 2 hours afterward for 8 hours. Function of the upper extremities was evaluated before the injections and 4 hours afterward. Muscle tone in the lower extremities was significantly decreased within 2 hours after baclofen injection and remained lower than baseline 8 hours afterward. Upper extremity tone and function were not significantly affected by these single doses. Confusion and drowsiness occurred in two of the youngest children in the study after the 50-micrograms dose, but cleared within 2 hours. Our findings indicate that intrathecal baclofen reduces spasticity in children with cerebral palsy, as it does in adults with spasticity of spinal origin. 
2	Interleukin 1 beta is expressed predominantly by enterocytes in experimental colitis. The cytokine interleukin 1 beta is an important mediator of inflammatory processes capable of inducing eicosanoid production, T-cell activation, and increased vascular permeability. In this study, in situ hybridization techniques were used to delineate the kinetics and cellular source of induced interleukin 1 beta in acute experimental colitis. The induction of interleukin 1 beta messenger RNA was an early phenomenon and occurred predominantly in undifferentiated cells located in the basal part of the mucosal crypts but not in differentiated enterocytes. The undifferentiated enterocytes retained the messenger RNA during differentiation and migration to more apical parts of the crypts. These results suggest that induction of interleukin 1 beta messenger RNA in enterocytes is causally related to the subsequent inflammatory changes seen in acute experimental colitis. 
3	Embolism of cerebral tissue: a cause of coagulopathy and cerebral infarction? Report of a case. We report a case of potentially survivable closed head injury, which was complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation and bilateral cerebral infarction. Autopsy disclosed pulmonary emboli composed of cerebral tissue. We suggest that the entry of brain tissue into the systemic blood circulation caused severe disseminated intravascular coagulation, with consequent thrombosis of cerebral veins and spreading infarction. 
5	Long-term suppression of tremor by chronic stimulation of the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus. The usefulness of high-frequency stimulation of the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) as the first neurosurgical procedure in disabling tremor was assessed in 26 patients with Parkinson's disease and 6 with essential tremor. 7 of these patients had already undergone thalamotomy contralateral to the stimulated side, and 11 others had bilateral Vim stimulation at the same time. Chronic stimulating electrodes connected to a pulse generator were implanted in the Vim. Tremor amplitude at rest, during posture holding, and during action and intention manoeuvres was assessed by means of accelerometry. Of the 43 thalami stimulated, 27 showed complete relief from tremor and 11 major improvement (88%). The improvement was maintained for up to 29 months (mean follow-up 13 [SD 9] months). Adverse effects were mild and could be eradicated by reduction or cessation of stimulation. This reversibility and adaptability, allowing control of side-effects, make thalamic stimulation preferable to thalamotomy, especially when treatment of both sides of the brain is needed. 
4	Endothelin family in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. To clarify whether endothelin may be present in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and, if it exists, to compare its molecular forms with those of endothelin in human plasma, we analyzed pooled human CSF and plasma by high performance liquid chromatography with specific enzyme immunoassays for each endothelin peptide. Of the four human endothelin peptides hitherto identified, big endothelin-1 was the major molecular form of endothelin present in human CSF. In addition, there was a small but significant amount of endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 in CSF, while endothelin-2 was not detectable. Similarly, big endothelin-1, endothelin-1, and endothelin-3 were identified in human plasma. Although big endothelin-1 was the most abundant, a substantial amount of endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 was found in plasma with a resultant lower molar ratio of big endothelin-1 to endothelin-1 than in CSF. In all CSF samples from 17 patients requiring diagnostic lumbar puncture or lumbar anesthesia, endothelin was detectable, with a preponderance of big endothelin-1 relative to endothelin-1 and endothelin-3. The mean concentrations of endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 in simultaneously collected plasma were significantly (P less than 0.01) higher than those in CSF, while there was no significant difference between the mean big endothelin-1 concentration in plasma and that in CSF. There was no significant correlation among concentrations of big endothelin-1, endothelin-1, and endothelin-3 in each paired sample. These results indicate that endothelin is present in human CSF that is differently processed from endothelin in vascular endothelial cells and suggest a possible role for endothelin as a modulator of neuronal functions. 
1	Gastric lymphoma causing granulocytopenia and cold intolerance, with recovery after treatment. A 34-year-old man was found to have granulocytopenia with a white blood count of 2.3 x 10(9) l-1, consisting of 10% segmented neutrophils, 50% monocytes and 40% lymphocytes. A bone marrow aspirate showed 20% promyelocytes and 10% blasts with monoblastic features, and a smouldering myelomonocytic leukaemia was considered to be a possible diagnosis. In cold weather the patient experienced cold intolerance with acrocyanosis and small ulcerations on the ears. The test for heparin-precipitable protein ('cryofibrinogen') was strongly positive. During the following year, these signs and symptoms persisted, and the patient also developed constant moderate pain in the epigastric region. Gastroscopy revealed a large lymphoma of the stomach, which was a high-grade malignant centroblastic type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. After successful removal of the tumour, and six courses of potent cytostatic combinations, the patient recovered completely, and the granulocytopenia and cold intolerance disappeared. 
4	Angiotensin II levels in hypertensive and normotensive pregnancies. We measured circulating angiotension II by radioimmunoassay in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension (n = 54), and compared these values with those obtained in women with normal pregnancy (n = 18) and in non pregnant women (n = 20). Pregnant women had statistically significantly higher plasma angiotensin II [mean (SD): 41.3 (12.6) pg/ml] than non-pregnant women [29.2 (11.3) pg/ml; P less than 0.004]. Angiotensin II concentrations in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension [mean (SD): 31.7 (16.2) pg/ml] were, on average, 25% lower than in normal pregnancy (P less than 0.003) and resembled those obtained in non-pregnant women. The lowest angiotensin II levels were found in women with more severe forms of pregnancy-induced hypertension, such as proteinuric or superimposed pregnancy-induced hypertension. Review of the published studies on angiotensin II and our data suggest that the conflict among studies on angiotensin II levels in pregnancy-induced hypertension is largely due to the heterogeneity of the study populations in the various reports. 
1	Role of ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. In 170 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, ultrasound showed a high sensitivity in identifying focal liver lesions. Fine needle aspiration biopsy guided by ultrasound yielded a pathological diagnosis in the majority of cases. The advantages of this technique, its high diagnostic yield and low cost, render the older technique of blind percutaneous biopsy using a coarse needle obsolete. Laparoscopy retains its essential role in selected cases. Complementary use of fine needle aspiration biopsy under ultrasound guidance and laparoscopy assures the highest rate of diagnostic accuracy in hepatocellular carcinoma. We confirm the poor sensitivity of alpha fetoprotein. 
3	Low plasma iron status and akathisia. Thirty patients were examined to test the hypothesis that a depletion of iron levels is associated with symptoms of akathisia. Fifteen akathisic patients were pair-matched with 15 non-akathisic patients. Plasma ferritin levels were significantly decreased in the akathisic patients, and there was a significant inverse correlation between plasma iron levels and akathisia rating. In addition, akathisia ratings were found to be correlated with a scale measuring symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. 
5	Hepatic oxygen and lactate extraction during stagnant hypoxia. As O2 delivery falls, tissues must extract increasing amounts of O2 from blood to maintain a normal O2 consumption. Below a critical delivery threshold, increases in O2 extraction cannot compensate for the falling delivery, and O2 uptake falls in a supply-dependent fashion. Numerous studies have identified a critical delivery in whole animals, but the regional contributions to the critical O2 delivery are less fully understood. In the present study, we explored the limits of O2 extraction in the isolated liver, seeking to determine 1) the normal relationship between O2 consumption and delivery in the liver and 2) the relationship of hepatic lactate extraction to the drop in hepatic O2 consumption at low O2 deliveries. To answer these questions, using support dogs as a source for oxygenated metabolically stable blood, we studied eight pump-perfused canine livers. By lowering the blood flow in a model of stagnant hypoxia, we explored the relationship between O2 consumption and delivery over the entire physiological range of O2 delivery. The critical O2 delivery was 28 +/- 5 (SD) ml.kg-1.min-1; the livers extracted 68 +/- 9% of the delivered O2 before reaching supply dependence. This suggests that the liver has an O2 extraction capacity quite similar to the body as a whole and not different from other tissues that have been isolated. At high blood flows, the livers extracted approximately 10% of the lactate delivered by the blood, but the arteriovenous lactate differences were small. At low blood flows, however, the livers changed from lactate consumption to production. The O2 delivery coinciding with the dropoff in lactate extraction did not differ significantly from the critical O2 delivery. We conclude that reductions in lactate uptake by the liver do not precede the transition to O2 supply dependence. 
5	The t(1;19)(q23;p13) results in consistent fusion of E2A and PBX1 coding sequences in acute lymphoblastic leukemias. The t(1;19)(q23;p13) chromosomal translocation is observed cytogenetically in 25% of children with pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and is associated with an adverse treatment outcome. The t(1;19) juxtaposes the E2A gene from chromosome 19 with the PBX1 gene on chromosome 1, leading to the production of fusion transcripts and resultant chimeric proteins that contain the transcriptional-activating motif of E2A and the DNA-binding homeodomain of PBX1. To investigate the molecular nature of E2A/PBX1 fusion in patients with t(1;19) ALL we used an RNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure to amplify a portion of the chimeric transcript. We detected E2A/PBX1 fusion transcripts in cells from 97% (37 of 38) of cases in which the t(1;19) had been observed cytogenetically. Molecular evidence of E2A/PBX1 fusion transcripts was also observed in a patient in whom a t(1;19) was not detected cytogenetically and in one patient with subclinical levels of minimal residual disease before overt clinical relapse. In all PCR-positive cases the junction of E2A and PBX1 coding sequences occurred at precisely the same location as demonstrated by hybridization of PCR products with a fusion site-specific detection oligonucleotide. These findings demonstrate the consistent fusion of E2A and PBX1 coding sequences resulting from t(1;19) and suggest that site-specific fusion of E2A and PBX1 is an important pathogenic event in t(1;19) ALL. 
4	Role of ultrasonic tissue characterization to distinguish reversible from irreversible myocardial injury. Tissue characterization reflects structural and functional integrity of tissues. Inasmuch as reversible ischemia causes no structural damage and irreversible ischemia results in persistent structural myocardial damage, we postulated that ultrasonic tissue characterization can distinguish the two types of injuries. Anesthetized open chest dogs underwent 15 minutes (group 1, n = 5) and 90 minutes (group 2, n = 8) of acute total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, followed by 3 hours of reperfusion. Myocardial ischemia-infarction was confirmed with segment shortening, electronmicroscopic examination, and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Integrated backscatter Rayleigh 5 (IBR5), a measure of ultrasonic backscatter, and Fourier coefficient of amplitude modulation (FAM), an index of cardiac cycle dependent variation in backscatter, were measured at baseline, during ischemia, and after reperfusion. Group 1 (reversible ischemia) showed an increase in IBR5 from -48 +/- 1.2 dB at control to -45 +/- 1.0 dB (p less than 0.01) during ischemia, which returned to baseline after reperfusion (-47 +/- 1.3 dB). FAM was blunted during ischemia (6.2 +/- 1.0 dB during control versus 1.2 +/- 1.0 dB during ischemia, p less than 0.01) and recovered completely during reperfusion. Segment shortening was abolished during ischemia (18% +/- 3% during control versus -12% +/- 5% during ischemia, p less than 0.01) and recovered partially during reperfusion (4% +/- 5%). The group 2 animals with irreversible myocardial injury showed an increase in IBR5, from -49 +/- 1.2 dB during control to -44 +/- 1.0 dB during ischemia (p less than 0.01) and paradoxical bulging of the ischemic region (17% +/- 3% to -7% +/- 3%, p less than 0.01) during ischemia. 
5	Neurodevelopmental performance of very-low-birth-weight infants with mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage. Outcome at 5 to 6 years of age. The neurodevelopmental outcome of 38 very-low-birth-weight neonates (birth weight, less than 1501 g) was followed up prospectively from birth to 5 to 6 years of age to assess the neurodevelopmental sequelae of mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage (grades I and II). All neonates were screened for periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage at 5 to 10 days of age. Eleven incurred a mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage (group 1) and 27 had no periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage (group 2). Each of the infants was neurodevelopmentally normal at 1 to 2 years of age. The 38 children were matched by race, age, sex, and socioeconomic status with control children (group 3) who had been born at term. On outcome measurements at 5 to 6 years of age, groups 1 and 2 scored significantly lower than group 3 on the combined test measurements and on three of the four individual measurements. Group 1 scored significantly lower than group 2 on the combined test measurements only. These data indicate that very-low-birth-weight infants are at risk for learning problems. Although children with mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage did not demonstrate a significant deficit on individual test scores, the significant difference on the combined battery suggests that mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage has an adverse effect on global performance. 
3	The effect of quinidine and mexiletine on the adaptation of ventricular refractoriness to an increase in rate. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of quinidine and mexiletine on the adaptation of ventricular refractoriness to a change in heart rate. The ventricular effective refractory period was measured at a basic drive cycle length of 500 msec with basic drive train durations of two beats, eight beats, 20 beats and 3 minutes. The ventricular refractory periods were measured in the baseline state and after oral treatment with quinidine or mexiletine in 20 subjects each. In the baseline state, there was progressive shortening of the ventricular refractory period as the drive train duration increased from two beats to 3 minutes. Quinidine prolonged refractoriness by 5% (p less than 0.001) at each drive train duration. Mexiletine did not affect the ventricular effective refractory period at any of the drive train durations. In a control group of 20 subjects, there were no significant differences between two determinations of refractoriness at each basic drive train duration. In conclusion, neither quinidine nor mexiletine affect the adaptation of ventricular refractoriness to an increase in rate. Although the ventricular effective refractory period measured with a conventional basic drive train duration of eight beats is often more than 20 msec longer than the actual ventricular effective refractory period measured with a drive train duration of 3 minutes, the effects of quinidine and mexiletine on the conventionally measured ventricular effective refractory period accurately reflect the effects of these drugs on the actual ventricular effective refractory period. 
4	Mechanical factors in large artery disease and antihypertensive drugs. Hypertension may induce early alterations in large arteries by 2 mechanical stresses: one related to intravascular pressure, the other to blood flow dynamics. Distending pressure force acts in a circumferential direction, inducing decreased arterial distensibility. Arterial distensibility can be evaluated in humans by measurement of arterial compliance and pulse-wave velocity. It is well established that in chronic hypertension age and elevated pressure act together to increase arterial rigidity. Blood flow dynamics induce frictional forces in the endothelial surfaces of arteries. These forces, expressed by shear stress, are proportional to the viscosity of the blood and to the velocity gradient at the arterial wall. Measurement of blood viscosity and evaluation of velocity profile in the brachial arteries of hypertensive subjects have shown a reduction in wall shear rate and stress despite the elevation in blood viscosity. Several studies have shown that drug therapy that successfully reduces blood pressure does not necessarily improve arterial compliance. In contrast, few data are available on the effects of antihypertensive medication on arterial wall shear in humans. Arterial compliance and wall shear stress are 2 main therapeutic targets of potential importance in the physiopharmacologic approach to the effects of hypertension on atherogenesis. 
5	Reconstruction of the severely atrophic edentulous mandible by means of autogenous bone grafts and simultaneous placement of osseointegrated implants. A method of reconstructing the severely atrophic mandible that simultaneously provides additional strength and the ability to house osseointegrated implants is presented. The performance of the procedure from an external approach minimizes the possibility of oral contamination and, therefore, infection. The procedure has been performed on 10 patients, with a longest follow-up of 3 years. A 93% success rate has been achieved, and bone resorption at the implant sites has thus far been negligible. Prosthetic rehabilitation has been done in 9 of the 10 cases; 3 have been tissue-supported prostheses, and 6 have been completely implant-supported prostheses. 
4	Intraoperative transesophageal color-coded Doppler echocardiography for evaluation of residual regurgitation after mitral valve repair. Because mitral valve competence after mitral valve reconstruction is awkward to assess during this procedure, we evaluated in this respect transesophageal color-coded Doppler echocardiography in 23 patients undergoing mitral valve reconstruction for severe mitral regurgitation. Transesophageal echocardiographic examinations were performed after induction of anesthesia but before sternotomy (baseline), after mitral valve repair before decannulation, and at sternal closure, all at similar mean aortic pressure and echocardiographic instrument settings. The degree of mitral regurgitation by transesophageal color Doppler flow mapping was visually quantified on a 5-point scale (0 to 4), pending the left atrial extent of the regurgitant jet. This was compared with the degree of mitral regurgitation by left ventricular cineangiography performed within several weeks after operation and also visually quantified on a 5-point scale (0 to 4), with use of the right anterior oblique projection. There was good correlation between the two methods (r = 0.83; p less than 0.001). We conclude that residual mitral regurgitation, as assessed by transesophageal color flow mapping in the operating room, highly correlates with the ultimate mitral regurgitation by cineangiography. Therefore transesophageal echocardiography can be helpful for evaluation of mitral valve competence during mitral valve reconstruction, and hence, in case of repair failure, allow valve replacement in the same surgical session, thus avoiding reoperation. 
2	Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of the carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen and the amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen as biochemical markers of growth activity were compared in 46 children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease. Significant correlations were noted between growth velocity and type I procollagen (r = 0.65; P less than 0.001) and type III procollagen concentrations (r = 0.64; P less than 0.001). Although the serum concentration of type I procollagen was generally about 15 times greater than that of type III, the respective serum concentrations were highly correlated (r = 0.66; P less than 0.001) at all growth velocities. The use of daily corticosteroid therapy was associated with significantly lower concentrations of both propeptides (P less than 0.01) than was alternate-day or no corticosteroid therapy, respectively. Children with growth arrest (0.0 cm/mo) had type I and type III procollagen concentrations similar to those found in adults. These observations indicate that the serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides reflect growth activity in children with inflammatory bowel disease and suggest that routine measurement of collagen propeptides may have clinical value in monitoring normal and abnormal growth. The data suggest that the measurement of one propeptide does not offer an advantage over the other. 
5	Role of phenytoin in healing of large abscess cavities. The promotion of healing of large abscess cavities attained with topical phenytoin was evaluated in controlled studies of clinical and experimental wounds. In the clinical abscess cavities, phenytoin application in 20 patients compared with conventional treatment in 20 patients resulted in earlier separation of slough, decrease in oedema, control of pain and overall enhanced healing. The mean(s.d.) rate of reduction of wound area was 2.02(0.48) cm2/day in the phenytoin group versus 1.58(0.51) cm2/day in controls (P less than 0.05) on day 10, and 1.8(0.32) cm2/day versus 1.19(0.21) cm2/day (P less than 0.01) on day 20. The mean volume reduction rates at both the 10th and 20th day were 0.48(0.01) cm3/day for phenytoin versus 0.32(0.04) cm3/day for controls; (P less than 0.005). By day 20, 17 of the patients treated with phenytoin were rated as having healed completely, compared with only one of the controls. In a standardized guinea-pig model of the clinical abscess cavity, which included inoculation of the wound with Bacillus proteus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, an enhanced healing rate was also observed (at 7 days 0.40(0.05) cm2/day with phenytoin versus 0.21(0.08) cm2/day in controls; P less than 0.005). All eight of the animals treated with phenytoin healed by day 21, compared with one of the eight controls. Biopsies of wounds treated with phenytoin showed less inflammation, no necrosis, and enhanced neovascularization, collagen deposition and fibroblast proliferation compared to controls. Bacterial colonies also decreased more rapidly with the use of phenytoin. 
1	Biopsy of the breast for mammographically detected lesions. We prospectively studied 718 women who underwent biopsy of the breast for suspicious, mammographically detected mammary lesions in an attempt to identify key clinical risk factors, as well as roentgenographic characteristics associated with the appearance of early carcinoma of the breast. Patients with a benign outcome had an average age of 55 years versus 63 years for patients with carcinoma of the breast. Seventy-six per cent of these patients had no previous history of mammary problems, 20 per cent had a positive family history for carcinoma of the breast, 58 per cent were premenopausal and 21 per cent had used birth control pills. Except for age (p less than 0.001), the distribution of clinical risk factors was equal among patients with benign or malignant outcomes. Suspicious mammographic findings included mass lesions (53 per cent), calcifications (36 per cent) and the association of both (11 per cent). The predominant Wolfe pattern on mammography was P1 (36 per cent). No relationship was observed between Wolfe pattern and malignant conditions. In this group of patients, mammography was poorly specific; however, the positive predictive value increased with age and is related to the age-specific prevalence of carcinoma of the breast. Eight hundred and twenty-five lesions were removed. Twenty-five per cent (n = 203) of the specimens taken at biopsy contained carcinoma. Stellate mass lesions were highly suggestive of a malignant growth (p less than 0.0001). No relationship between the size of the suspicious mammographic mass and the malignant lesion was observed. A marked correlation (chi-square test with Yate's correction) was observed between malignant tumor and lesions with a linear or branching pattern, more than 15 calcifications, or small sized calcifications. The presence of a mass with calcifications was associated with carcinoma in 34 per cent. The incidence of invasive carcinoma was much higher for mass lesions (81 per cent) than for suspicious calcifications (56 per cent) (p less than 0.0001). 
3	Intracranial aneurysms: interventional neurovascular treatment with detachable balloons--results in 215 cases Patients with complex or surgically difficult intracranial aneurysms are being treated with interventional neurovascular techniques. With neuroleptic anesthesia and a transfemoral femoral approach, a silicone micro-balloon can be flow directed through the intracranial circulation, guided directly into the aneurysm, and detached. The aneurysm is thus eliminated from the circulation, and the parent artery is preserved. For broad-based or ectatic aneurysms, test occlusion followed by permanent occlusion of the aneurysm and parent vessel can be performed. Since 1981, 211 patients with 215 aneurysms, including 177 cases involving the anterior and 38 cases involving the posterior circulation, have been treated with this technique. In 127 cases (59.1%), the parent vessel was occluded; in 88 cases (40.9%), primary occlusion of the aneurysm was achieved with preservation of the parent artery. Therapy-related complications included 21 deaths (9.8%) and 16 strokes (7.4%). Follow-up examinations were performed at 1, 3, and 12 months after treatment, and follow-up ranged from 5 months to 9 years. In patients in whom standard surgical therapy fails or for aneurysms in surgically inaccessible anatomic locations, interventional techniques that make use of detachable balloons may be a useful therapeutic alternative. 
2	Alpha 1-antitrypsin granules in the liver--always important? We have studied the clinical histories and liver biopsy findings in 1951 consecutive adult patients with suspected chronic liver disease, and in four known PiZ-homozygous alpha 1-antitrypsin-deficient patients with emphysema (candidates for lung transplant) and no known liver disease, in order to assess the importance of periportal alpha 1-antitrypsin granules in the liver and their possible causal role in liver disease, and to assess the value of possible screening tests. Periportal granules were found in 30 (1.5 per cent) of the 1951 liver biopsies and in all four known PiZ-homozygous subjects. They were the sole putative aetiological agent in eight of 85 patients (9.4 per cent) with otherwise cryptogenic cirrhosis and present in 2.5 per cent of patients with cirrhosis of known aetiology (alcohol, autoimmune etc.). All but one were Z phenotype (seven homozygotes, 22 heterozygotes). alpha 1-Antitrypsin granules were seen in 12 patients (including three of four lung transplant candidates) with no histological chronic liver disease. Determination of serum alpha 1-antitrypsin levels was quite unhelpful in identifying these patients. This study does not support the concept that periportal alpha 1-antitrypsin granules are necessarily pathogenic, but in some cases they may be causally related to otherwise cryptogenic liver disease. The presence of granules gave no important diagnostic, therapeutic or prognostic information. 
1	Generation of human monoclonal antibodies against colon cancer. Lymphocytes from regional lymph nodes of patients with colon cancer were fused with a human lymphoblastoid cell line with or without in vitro immunization. The efficacy of these two protocols for the generation of human monoclonal antibodies against colon cancer was investigated. The hyperplastic lymph nodes adjacent to the tumor were the best source of B lymphocytes. Fusion frequency and the number of tumor-reactive clones were markedly increased when the in vitro immunization protocol was applied prior to fusion. As a stimulant in in vitro immunization, the supernatant of pokeweed mitogen-stimulated T lymphocytes was superior to the supernatant of mixed lymphocytes culture. Carcinoembryonic antigen at 20 micrograms/L seemed to be the optimal dose for in vitro immunization. The reactivities of human monoclonal antibodies thus generated were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by immunoperoxidase staining. Combining in vitro immunization with lymphocytes of cancer patients may lead to the successful production of clinically useful human monoclonal antibodies. 
4	Left ventricular regional wall stress in dilated cardiomyopathy. Left ventriculography with simultaneous pressure micromanometry was performed in 11 normal control subjects and 17 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Left ventricular silhouettes in the right anterior oblique projection were divided into eight areas, and regional wall stress was computed by Janz's method in each area excluding the two most basal areas. Wall stress was higher in DCM patients than in control subjects (p less than 0.01). The percent area changes from end diastole to end systole in each area were lower in DCM patients than in control subjects (mean for six areas, 22 +/- 14% versus 54 +/- 9%, respectively, p less than 0.01), but the coefficient of variation for the percent area changes in the six areas of the left ventricle in DCM patients was greater than that in control subjects (32 +/- 17% versus 15 +/- 4%, respectively, p less than 0.01), indicating regional differences in hypokinesis. There was a significant negative correlation between end-systolic regional wall stress and percent area change (r = -0.60 to -0.86, p less than 0.05) in each area. Thus, excessive regional afterload may play an important role in causing regional hypokinesis in DCM. 
4	Spontaneous changes in ventricular tachycardia cycle length. Understanding spontaneous fluctuations in ventricular tachycardia cycle length is required to develop algorithms for ventricular tachycardia detection and termination. Variations in cycle length, time to stable cycle length and the range of RR intervals during ventricular tachycardia were analyzed in 74 episodes of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia induced in patients not taking antiarrhythmic medication. Linear regression demonstrated cycle length variability to decrease over time (41 +/- 24 to 17 +/- 19 ms, p less than 0.001). Slower ventricular tachycardia had more cycle length variability than faster ventricular tachycardia (p less than 0.001). Ventricular tachycardia that was initially more variable tended to remain more variable (p less than 0.001). Fifty-four percent of episodes stabilized within the first 15 beats, 75% by 30 beats and 93% by 50 beats. The number of beats to stable cycle length was independent of ventricular tachycardia rate. The average range in cycle length per episode was 127 +/- 72 ms; 12% of ventricular tachycardia episodes varied by less than 50 ms and 45% by less than 150 ms. The maximal range in RR intervals from a single episode of ventricular tachycardia was 290 ms. Therefore, ventricular tachycardia demonstrates a wide range of cycle lengths and has time-dependent changes in variability and stability. These cycle length changes should be considered in the algorithms for ventricular tachycardia detection and termination by automatic antitachycardia devices. 
4	Infrarenal abdominal aortic disease: a review of the retroperitoneal approach. Transabdominal exposure is the most widely used surgical approach to the infrarenal aorta. Over the last 30 years a number of surgeons have championed the retroperitoneal approach for repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms and aortoiliac occlusive disease using a variety of incisions. Several studies attest to the clinical superiority of this approach over the transabdominal route and recent evidence demonstrates reduced physiological disturbance with this technique. The retroperitoneal approach is suitable for all elective operations on the abdominal aorta, particularly in patients with high-risk aneurysms and in selected patients with symptomatic and ruptured aneurysms. 
4	Percutaneous angioscopy during coronary angioplasty using a steerable microangioscope. The feasibility of using a flexible, steerable angioscope to perform coronary angioscopy before and after percutaneous coronary angioplasty was tested. The microangioscope fits through an 8F coronary angioplasty guiding catheter and contains a multifiber viewing bundle incorporated into the body of a 4.3F balloon catheter with a central lumen for distal flushing and guide-wire passage. Angioscopy was performed without complications 45 times in 24 patients, including 6 patients with stable and 18 with unstable angina. Circumferential visualization of the target lesion was successful in 20 (83%) of the 24 patients and improved with operator experience. Excellent visualization of the target lesion was achieved in 16 (94%) of the last 17 patients. Plaque, thrombus and dissection were among the abnormal findings in the 20 patients (4 with stable, 16 with unstable angina) in whom circumferential viewing of the target lesion was achieved. In four patients with restenosis after angioplasty, the lesion morphology was distinctly different from that of lesions in arteries without prior angioplasty. In patients with stable angina, no thrombus or dissection was seen by angiography or angioscopy before angioplasty. In patients with unstable angina, thrombus was detected more frequently by angioscopy than by angiography before angioplasty (8 versus 2 of 16) and after (15 versus 2 of 16) angioplasty. Intimal dissection was also seen much more frequently by angioscopy than by angiography before angioplasty (7 versus 0 of 16) and after angioplasty (16 versus 7 of 16). It is concluded that high resolution percutaneous coronary angioscopy can be performed safely in conjunction with balloon angioplasty. Further investigation is needed before this diagnostic tool can be applied clinically. 
4	Fluosol: an oxygen-delivery fluid for use in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Fluosol (20% intravascular perfluorochemical emulsion) is an oxygen-carrying emulsion used to deliver oxygen to ischemic myocardium during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Fluosol is composed of two perfluorochemicals, perfluorodecalin and perfluorotripropylamine. It has a high capacity for oxygen solubility, a low viscosity, and a small particle size. Following administration, the perfluorochemicals in fluosol are not metabolized. Rather, most are expired as gaseous particles through the lungs; the remainder are taken up by the organs of the reticuloendothelial system and later expired. When administered during balloon inflation in PTCA, fluosol preserves ventricular wall motion and global left ventricular ejection fraction. In addition, it minimizes ST segment changes and preserves cardiac output. Fluosol may be especially useful in patients who have poor contractile reserve, multivessel disease, or serious underlying illness. Other uses under investigation include limitation of myocardial infarct size and chemosensitization or radiosensitization of malignant tumors. Adverse effects secondary to the use of fluosol include ventricular arrhythmias, pruritus, bradycardia, chest pain, dyspnea, and increased respiratory rate. Fluosol must be thawed, admixed, warmed to body temperature, and oxygenated prior to intracoronary administration. The usual administration rate is 60 mL/min during each balloon inflation. 
5	The relationship of headache symptoms with severity and duration of attacks. Efforts to develop clinically useful headache classification schemes have generally focused on linking specific symptom groupings with specific headache subtypes. An alternative conceptual approach, the "severity model" of headache, considers a continuum of headache ranging from mild to severe forms with specific headache subtypes distinguished by level of severity rather than unique constellations of symptoms. A population-based telephone interview was carried out among 10,169 subjects aged 12-29 to estimate the prevalence of serious headaches and better characterize symptoms that accompany headache attacks. In an analysis of frequency of occurrence, pain and duration of recent (within 4 weeks prior to interview) headache attacks, the data revealed that common symptoms (such as forehead pain and pain in the back of the head, neck and shoulders) were reported frequently, but headaches with these symptoms were generally characterized by low levels of pain and short duration. Although not an original study objective, the data were analyzed to determine whether distinct symptom constellations could be identified or whether symptoms overlapped between headache types. Symptoms of migraine were frequently experienced concomitant with tension-type symptoms; the resultant headaches were usually characterized as moderate in intensity. In contrast, symptoms usually associated with migraine in the absence of concomitant tension-type symptoms were infrequently experienced, but resulted in headaches causing the greatest disability. The data provide some support for the severity model of headache. 
3	Outpatient management of schizophrenia. As effective antipsychotic pharmacotherapy has become available, patients with schizophrenia are increasingly managed in an outpatient setting by primary care physicians. Pharmacotherapy is generally effective in treating "positive," or psychotic, symptoms and lessening the risks of relapse, but ineffective in improving "negative," or deficit, symptoms. Aggressive attempts to totally control positive symptoms and to ameliorate negative symptoms tend to increase side effects and may be detrimental to the patient. Intensive psychotherapeutic and rehabilitative approaches are generally unproductive. Attempting to obtain a cure is unrealistic. A moderate approach is recommended, taking into consideration the limitations of existing treatments, achieving control of extreme symptoms and minimizing social and occupational limitations. 
4	Transaortic endarterectomy of renal visceral artery lesions in association with infrarenal aortic surgery. The complexity of infrarenal aortic reconstruction increases when bypass grafts to revascularize associated renal and visceral arteries are needed. Lesions in these vessels, however, are usually limited to their aortic orifices and therefore are amenable to retroperitoneal transaortic endarterectomy. A combined infrarenal aortic reconstruction and transaortic endarterectomy of the renal/visceral vessels was used in 18 (16%) of 120 patients undergoing elective infrarenal aortic reconstruction over a 2-year-period. Transaortic endarterectomy was performed primarily for renal preservation in 11 patients with bilateral, high-grade renal artery stenoses and abnormal renal function (serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.9 mg/dl). In seven patients transaortic endarterectomy was performed as a secondary procedure during the course of complex reconstruction of aneurysmal or occlusive aortic disease. Mean serum creatinine, which was elevated preoperatively in 14 (78%) patients (3.3 mg/dl), decreased significantly after the operation (2.0 mg/dl, p less than 0.01). A single death occurred in the 18 patients undergoing transaortic endarterectomy. Renal function preservation can be achieved by renal revascularization in patients with bilateral renal artery stenoses and decreased renal function. The retroperitoneal approach to aortic reconstruction and the use of transaortic endarterectomy allows correction of most renal/visceral vessel involvement in complex aortic revascularization procedures. 
1	Regional differences in the intranodal distribution of tumor cells. The intranodal distribution of tumor cells was examined in 103 mesenteric and 135 axillary nodes to determine the frequency of a circumferential type of distribution and its relationship, if any, to central necrosis. Eighteen percent of the mesenteric nodes removed at surgery from patients with colon cancer contained a circumferential rim of viable tumor cells in an area corresponding wholly or in part to the normal location of the marginal sinus. In each case this rim of tumor cells surrounded a large central area of necrosis. In contrast, only one of the 135 axillary nodes removed from patients with breast cancer demonstrated this pattern. These findings suggest that by interrupting blood and lymph vessels, the circumferential spread of tumor cells underlies development of central necrosis. Previously described structural dissimilarities between mesenteric and axillary nodes may explain the striking difference in incidence of this pattern in these nodes. 
4	The effects of epidural anesthesia on the Doppler velocimetry of umbilical and uterine arteries in normal and hypertensive patients during active term labor. To study the effects of epidural anesthesia on uterine and umbilical artery blood flow in preeclampsia, we observed 25 patients in active labor at 36 or more weeks' gestation. Seven had preeclampsia, eight had chronic hypertension, and ten had no complications. Doppler velocimetry of the uterine and umbilical arteries was performed before and after intravenous fluid loading and at 30 and 60 minutes after epidural blockade. Maternal vital signs and fetal heart rate were monitored continuously. After epidural block, mean maternal blood pressure fell significantly in all groups, but no maternal hypotension was observed. Mean maternal and fetal heart rates were unchanged. After epidural block, mean uterine artery systolic-diastolic (S-D) ratios did not change in the chronic-hypertension and normal groups, but fell significantly in the preeclamptic group to values similar to those of the normal group. Umbilical artery S-D ratios did not change in any group. In preeclamptic pregnancy, epidural anesthesia may help to reduce uterine artery vasospasm and may benefit intrapartum fetal well-being. 
5	Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an intermediate in IL-1-induced proliferation of leukemic human megakaryoblasts. We have examined the in vitro effects of recombinant human (rh) interleukin-1 (IL-1) on the growth of purified megakaryoblasts obtained from patients with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. We demonstrate that both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta treatment of these cells led to stimulation of DNA synthesis (as shown by increase of 3H-thymidine incorporation up to 35-fold) and also resulted in colony formation of leukemic megakaryoblasts. However, the stimulatory effect of IL-1 was dependent on endogenous production of IL-6, because addition of neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to IL-6 abrogated the stimulatory activity of IL-1. In contrast, neutralizing MoAbs to granulocyte (G)-colony stimulating factor (CSF), granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF, and macrophage (M)-CSF failed to counteract the growth-enhancing effects of IL-1. Leukemic megakaryoblasts accumulated IL-6 mRNA and released IL-6 protein into their culture supernatant when exposed to rh IL-1 but failed to disclose transcripts for G-, GM-, and M-CSF under these conditions. Analysis of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) transcript levels demonstrated that megakaryoblasts constitutively expressed IL-6R mRNA and that these transcripts are down-regulated to undetectable levels upon exposure to IL-1 and IL-6. Increase of 3H-thymidine incorporation by megakaryoblasts could be duplicated by exogenous IL-6 that could be blocked by neutralizing MoAb to IL-6. In conclusion, our results suggest that leukemic megakaryoblasts could produce and secrete IL-6, and express IL-6R, and that the growth-enhancing effect of IL-1 on these cells is indirect, via production of IL-6 by leukemic cells. 
4	Mechanisms of reoxygenation injury in cultured ventricular myocytes To investigate factors contributing to reperfusion and reoxygenation myocardial injury, we exposed layers of cultured chick ventricular myocytes to severe hypoxia for up to 3 hours in the presence of 20 mM 2-deoxyglucose, zero glucose, and 5 mM pyruvate, and then exposed the myocytes to reoxygenation. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was moderately increased during 3 hours of hypoxia but was increased markedly during reoxygenation. Coincident changes in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and cell motion were also measured during hypoxia and reoxygenation. During hypoxia, [Ca2+]i increased to more than 1 microM, and with reoxygenation, [Ca2+]i abruptly decreased slightly but remained elevated more than 1 microM. Cells developed a stable rigor after 30 minutes of hypoxia. Reoxygenation caused a marked hypercontracture within 5 minutes. Pretreatment of myocytes with either 2,3-butanedione monoxime, which inhibits Ca2(+)-dependent force development, or cyanide inhibited reoxygenation hypercontracture. LDH release after reoxygenation was also significantly reduced in the presence of 2,3-butanedione monoxime. Treatment of myocytes with superoxide dismutase and catalase during hypoxia also resulted in a decrease in LDH release during reoxygenation. We conclude that an abrupt increase in [Ca2+]i during reoxygenation does not account for reoxygenation injury. However, in the presence of elevated [Ca2+]i, reoxygenation and the resulting probable resynthesis of ATP causes [Ca2+]i-dependent myofilament crossbridge cycling, and the resulting hypercontracture contributes to myocyte damage. The generation of oxygen free radicals after reoxygenation also appears to contribute to cell injury in this system. 
5	Bilateral vocal cord hematomas associated with shoulder harness use. A case of bilateral vocal cord hematomas caused by a shoulder harness injury is presented. The patient was restrained by a three-point belt system and was involved in a front-end collision. She presented with mild facial and chest injuries and a contusion of the neck. One hour after injury she began to complain of hoarseness without airway compromise. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy showed bilateral true vocal cord hematomas. The patient had an uneventful hospital course and a full recovery. The importance of the mechanism of injury and associated injuries is discussed. 
1	Spinal instability secondary to metastatic cancer. Fifty-five patients with severe pain from spinal instability secondary to metastatic cancer were referred to Hope Hospital, none being judged to be in a terminal condition. One patient had too extensive disease for surgery so 54 were treated by 55 spinal stabilisations; 49 obtained complete relief of pain and two had partial relief. There were three failures. Twenty-eight of the patients had clinical evidence of spinal cord or cauda equina compression and were decompressed at the time of stabilisation. Of these, 20 had major recovery of neurological function. Patients with pre-operative evidence of extradural tumour had 'prophylactic' decompression at the time of stabilisation; none of these patients later developed signs of cord or cauda equina compression. The results suggest that alleviation of pain and restoration of mobility are best achieved by segmental spinal stabilisation; a few patients require a combined anterior and posterior stabilisation. Postoperative radiotherapy should be given whenever possible, and the causative tumour should be treated by endocrine or chemotherapy, as indicated. 
2	Possible role of leukotrienes in gastritis associated with Campylobacter pylori. This study was done to evaluate the role of leukotrienes (LTs) in gastritis associated with Campylobacter pylori. Biopsy specimens of gastric mucosa were obtained endoscopically from 18 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia for bacteriological and histological examination and extraction of LTs. There was correlation between the LTB4 level in the mucosa and the degree of gastritis evaluated histologically. The level was higher when infiltration of neutrophils in the gastric mucosa was more extensive. The LTB4 level in mucosa infected with C. pylori was higher than that in noninfected mucosa. These findings suggest that endogenous LTs may be related to the pathogenesis of gastritis associated with C. pylori. 
1	Radiation therapy of early (stages I and II-A) seminoma of testis after initial orchiectomy. With initial orchiectomy and radiation therapy, the prognosis of the patients with early (Stages I and II-A) testicular seminoma is nearing almost 100 percent. Thirty-two patients with Stage I and 13 patients with Stage II-A seminoma of the testis were treated with initial orchiectomy. This was followed by estimation biochemical markers and radiologic investigations. All the patients with Stage I disease received radiotherapy to the ipsilateral pelvic and para-aortic nodes. The patients with Stage II-A disease also received radiation therapy to the supradiaphragmatic regions. The disease-free survival in both groups of patients was found to be 100 percent. 
3	Beneficial effect of 1,3-butanediol on cerebral energy metabolism and edema following brain embolization in rats. We assessed the effect of 1,3-butanediol on cerebral energy metabolism and edema after inducing multifocal brain infarcts in 108 rats by the intracarotid injection of 50-microns carbonized microspheres. An ethanol dimer that induces systemic ketosis, 25 mmol/kg i.p. butanediol was injected every 3 hours to produce a sustained increase in the plasma level of beta-hydroxybutyrate. Treatment significantly attenuated ischemia-induced metabolic changes by increasing the concentrations of phosphocreatine, adenosine triphosphate, and glycogen and by reducing the concentrations of pyruvate and lactate. Lactate concentration 2, 6, and 12 hours after embolization decreased by 13%, 44%, and 46%, respectively. Brain water content increased from 78.63% in six unembolized rats to 80.93% in 12 saline-treated and 79.57% in seven butanediol-treated rats 12 hours after embolization. (p less than 0.05). The decrease in water content was associated with significant decreases in the concentrations of sodium and chloride. The antiedema effect of butanediol could not be explained by an osmotic mechanism since equimolar doses of urea or ethanol were ineffective. Our results support the hypothesis that the beneficial effect of butanediol is mediated through cerebral utilization of ketone bodies arising from butanediol metabolism, reducing the rate of glycolysis and the deleterious accumulation of lactic acid during ischemia. 
3	Barrett's esophagus in children and young adults. Frequent association with mental retardation. Since few data are available on epidemiologic features of Barrett's esophagus in young persons, we reviewed the case records of patients undergoing esophageal biopsies at Children's Hospital, Boston, from 1982 through 1986. There were 1423 esophageal biopsies obtained from 1173 patients, and histological evidence of esophagitis was present in 397 cases; Barrett's epithelium was diagnosed in 10 patients (0.9% of total and 2.5% of esophagitis cases). Specialized columnar epithelium was present in seven of these 10 patients. The mean age of those with Barrett's epithelium was 19.0 +/- 7.9 years (range 3.7-27 years) compared to 8.7 +/- 6.7 years (range 4 days to 31 years) for all patients biopsied (P less than 0.0001); 80% (8/10) of the Barrett's cases were male compared to 54% of all cases. The relative importance of the possible risk factors was assessed by comparing the 10 patients with Barrett's with the 541 patients that had esophageal biopsies in calendar years 1984-1985. Mental retardation, a risk factor not previously described for young persons with Barrett's esophagitis, was present in 70% (7/10) of the Barrett's patients but in only 15% of all patients biopsied (P less than 0.0002). The frequency of mental retardation was also higher, but not significantly so (P greater than 0.07), in patients with biopsies that were positive for esophagitis (19%) than in those with normal biopsies (14%). No significant differences were found between the Barrett's group and all patients biopsied in regards to racial origin, prior stricture, or fundoplication. 
1	High- versus standard-dose megestrol acetate in women with advanced breast cancer: a phase III trial of the Piedmont Oncology Association. One hundred seventy-two patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to receive oral standard-dose megestrol acetate (MA), 160 mg/d or high-dose MA, 800 mg/d. All but two patients had one prior trial of tamoxifen therapy for either metastatic disease (74%) or as adjuvant treatment (26%). Pretreatment characteristics were similar for both arms. High-dose MA resulted in a superior complete plus partial response rate (27% v 10%, P = .005), time to treatment failure (median, 8.0 v 3.2 months, P = .019), and survival (median, 22.4 v 16.5 months, P = .04) when compared with standard-dose therapy. These differences remained significant after adjustment for other covariates. Thirty-four patients were given high-dose MA after failure of standard-dose MA treatment, and none responded. Weight gain was the most distressing side effect, with 13% of standard-dose and 43% of high-dose patients gaining more than 20 lbs. Four major cardiovascular events occurred in patients receiving high-dose treatment and one in patients given standard doses. Other toxicity was modest. High-dose MA may represent a significant improvement in secondary endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer patients refractory to initial endocrine treatment, but its use on a regular basis should be reserved until these results are confirmed by other clinical trials. 
1	Flow cytometric DNA index in the prognosis of colorectal cancer. The authors investigated the relationship between flow cytometric DNA index (DI, defined as the ratio of the DNA content of malignant cells to that of normal cells) and other prognostic factors (grade and stage, anatomical site, age and sex) with the survival of 115 patients with colorectal cancer. Multiple biopsy specimens from 62 patients were taken during colonoscopy before surgery. Additional samples from 53 patients were obtained from paraffin-embedded material. All patients were treated with surgery only. Fresh-frozen material gave higher incidence of DNA aneuploidy than paraffin-embedded material (79% versus 41%). The patients with DNA diploid tumors (DI = 1) had a better overall survival than those with DNA aneuploid tumors (DI = 1). Among DNA aneuploid tumors, those with DI greater than 1.2 (excluding DI = 2) were worse than those with DI = 1.2 (excluding DI = 1) and DI = 2. Cox's regression analysis showed that pathologic stage was more important for prognosis than DNA index, whereas age, sex, histologic grade, and anatomic site were removed from the analysis as not relevant for prognosis. Relative risk of death (RR), in reference to patients with DI = 1 and Stages A + B (RR = 1), were RR = 1.8 for patients with carcinomas with Stage C. RR = 2.7 for patients with carcinomas with DNA near-diploid and DNA tetraploid tumors. RR = 3.5 for those with DI greater than 1.2 (excluding DI = 2), and RR = 8.0 for those with Stage D. These data indicate that flow cytometrically evaluated DI values have a relevant independent power for predicting the clinical outcome of colorectal cancer patients. 
1	The expression of progesterone receptors coincides with an arrest of DNA synthesis in human breast cancer. Two main models to account for the heterogeneous expression of estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) in human breast cancer have been proposed: the clonal model and the stem cell model. The authors previously provided evidence supporting the stem cell model since it was found that most of the proliferating cells in ER-positive (ER+) human breast cancer lack ER and that the ER-negative (ER-) and ER+ subpopulations are interrelated. The authors have analyzed in eighteen ER+/PR+ primary breast tumors the simultaneous expression of ER or PR (by immunohistochemistry) and DNA synthesis (by autoradiography) after 30 minutes of 3H-thymidine incorporation. The authors demonstrated that: (1) the average numbers of ER+ and PR+ cells were similar (36.8 +/- 10.7% and 39.3 +/- 17.6%, respectively); (2) The thymidine-labeling indexes of the ER+, ER-, PR+, and PR- subpopulations were 0.53 +/- 0.69%, 0.74 +/- 0.49%, 0.21 +/- 0.21 and 0.94 +/- 0.54%, respectively; and (3) 75.2% of the DNA-synthesizing cells were ER-, and 88.8% of them were PR-. The authors conclude that the cellular subpopulations expressing ER and PR were not identical, and the expression of PR was associated with a lower rate of cellular proliferation than was ER expression. 
4	Coronary flow and mental stress. Experimental findings. The hemodynamic, electrocardiographic, and coronary flow responses to a psychological test were studied in 13 pigs both in the absence (group 1, n = 8) and the presence (group 2, n = 5) of a transient occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The psychological test consisted of presenting food to a fasting but restrained animal for 3 minutes. In group 1, stress increased the heart rate from 128 +/- 5 to 176 +/- 8 beats/min (mean +/- SEM) and arterial pressure from 93 +/- 4 to 112 mm Hg. Comparing the individual increase in rate-pressure product with the increase in coronary conductance during the test, a parallel response was found in only two animals, whereas a relatively lower coronary conductance was observed in the remainder, suggesting vasoconstriction. Clinical signs of ischemia or life-threatening arrhythmias were never observed in this group of animals. Each group 2 animal underwent two occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery, randomly performed on separate days both in the presence and the absence of the food deprivation stress. When the latter was applied in the presence of occlusion, all animals developed ventricular fibrillation in less than 2 minutes (mean, 81.4 seconds). Conversely, only one animal had ventricular fibrillation when a 3-minute occlusion was performed without exposure to stress. This occurred despite the fact that more severe ischemia (as detected by an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and decreases in dP/dt and systolic pressure) was recorded at 3 minutes of occlusion. 
3	Multiple noncontiguous spine fractures. The data from a prospective study of 508 spine injuries were reviewed to determine the incidence of multiple noncontiguous spine fractures. All patients were examined at admission and at 1 and 2 years postinjury. This series identified 77 (15.2%) multilevel fractures. Motor vehicle accidents were the primary cause of these fractures. The incidence of neurologic injury was not significantly different between multiple noncontiguous and single fractures. Failure to use seat belts and ejection from the vehicle were the main factors associated with multiple noncontiguous spine injuries. Seven major fracture patterns were identified, which accounted for 60% of these injuries. The prognosis for multilevel spine fractures was not significantly worse that that for single-level injuries. 
5	Laryngeal dystonia: a series with botulinum toxin therapy. Laryngeal dystonia is a syndrome characterized by action-induced, involuntary spasms of the laryngeal muscles. Most patients have involvement of the adductor laryngeal muscles producing uncontrolled spasms during phonation, and a "strain-strangle" speech pattern commonly termed "spastic dysphonia." Other patients have involvement of the abductor muscles producing "whispering dysphonia." Rare patients have paradoxical vocal cord motion during respiration with adductor spasms on inspiration. Over the past 5 years we have used botulinum toxin (BOTOX) to treat more than 200 patients with laryngeal dystonia. This group includes patients with adductor involvement (phonatory dystonia, recurrent laryngeal nerve section failure, respiratory dystonia) and those with abductor involvement (whispering dystonia). Patients received benefit within 24 to 72 hours, with sustained improvement for 2 to 9 months with an average of 4 months. Patients improved to an average of 90% of normal function. Clinically significant adverse effects included extended breathy dysphonia and mild choking on fluids. BOTOX has become our treatment of choice for dystonic conditions of the larynx. 
4	Surgical repair of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome complicated with myocardial bridging. Myocardial bridging causes myocardial ischemia during supraventricular tachycardia. We present a case of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome combined with myocardial bridging. The patient complained of angina pectoris during paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia because of severe constriction of the left anterior descending coronary artery during systole. A myocardial scintigram revealed myocardial ischemia in the anteroseptal wall during paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Myotomy to prevent myocardial bridging and interruption of the accessory conduction pathway was successfully accomplished in a one-stage operation. 
5	Long-term results of submandibular duct transposition for drooling. This study examines the long-term results and morbidity of submandibular duct transposition in drooling children. Twenty-two patients, aged 3 to 18 years, with neurological dysfunction and excessive drooling underwent submandibular duct transposition between 1984 and 1987. In January 1990, 20 patients were reviewed. Their degree of drooling pre-operatively, immediately post-operatively and currently was assessed. The rate of improvement and the occurrence of complications were noted. Drooling was 'much better' in the early post-operative period in 17 of the 20 patients, and this improvement was invariably noted within three weeks. In the three other patients drooling was 'better'. Deterioration occurred in only three patients over the entire follow-up period. Complications all occurred in the first 18 months following surgery; they consisted of salivary retention cysts in four and transient submandibular gland swelling in a fifth patient. 
5	Hepatocyte expression of HBcAg and serum HBeAg in hepatitis B: comparison of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies during a trial of interferon. The distribution and quantitative expression of HBcAg in relation to serum HBeAg and liver histology before and after a trial of interferon in 50 patients with chronic type B hepatitis were evaluated using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. In general, both antisera showed a similar pattern in terms of the distribution of HBcAg, with predominant localisation of HBcAg in the cytoplasm in HBeAg positive patients with chronic active hepatitis. Semiquantitative analysis showed, however, that there was a higher degree of cytoplasmic expression of HBcAg with polyclonal than with monoclonal anti-HBc. Some of the HBeAg positive patients with only a focal expression of HBcAg in the cytoplasm by polyclonal anti-HBc showed no expression of HBcAg with monoclonal anti-HBc. The expression of HBcAg with polyclonal anti-HBc correlated better with the histological features of chronic active hepatitis or the persistence of serum HBeAg on follow up, suggesting that it did not result from non-specific or false positive staining. All of the HBeAg negative patients with minimal histological changes or inactive cirrhosis were HBcAg negative with both antisera. In conclusion, though both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies produced a quite similar distribution of HBcAg in patients with chronic type B hepatitis, polyclonal antibody seemed to be more sensitive in detecting HBcAg in the cytoplasm than did monoclonal anti-HBc, and the expression of HBcAg with polyclonal anti-HBc correlated better with the clinical and histological outcome. 
1	Measurement techniques for melanoma: a statistical comparison Inter- and intra-observer variation in measuring the depth of invasion of malignant melanomas was assessed using three different techniques: eye-piece graticule, stage Vernier, and projection image analysis. Significant variation was found for all methods but was least pronounced with the stage Vernier. It is recommended that this should be the preferred technique for routine use. 
5	One hundred percent oxygen reverses muscle hypoxia in a rat hindlimb model of acute arterial occlusion. Significant morbidity results from extremity ischemia after acute arterial occlusion. Reestablishment of arterial flow is considered to be the ideal treatment, yet substantial tissue loss can occur before this is accomplished. Using a rat hindlimb model we investigated whether the administration of 100% oxygen would decrease tissue hypoxia from acute arterial occlusion. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used, and Po2 recordings were taken from the gastrocnemius muscle by use of an oxygen electrode. Baseline muscle Po2 was recorded, and then the femoral artery was occluded. Repeat recordings were made after 20 minutes of ventilation with room air and after an additional 20 minutes of ventilation with 100% oxygen (N = 10). Control groups consisted of animals undergoing occlusion but continued on room air (N = 3) and animals undergoing sham occlusion but receiving the period of 100% oxygen ventilation (N = 3). Femoral artery occlusion produced a reduction in muscle Po2 from 28.0 +/- 1.4 to 6.1 +/- 2.0 (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.001). Ventilation with 100% oxygen reversed the tissue hypoxia produced by occlusion (27.3 +/- 2.0, p less than 0.001). The administration of 100% oxygen without femoral artery occlusion resulted in a higher tissue Po2 than the occluded + oxygen group (94 +/- 12 vs 27.3 +/- 2.0, p less than 0.001). Mean arterial blood pressure increased in the experimental group concomitant with the administration of 100% oxygen, but there was no correlation between final blood pressure and final tissue oxygen tension. 
5	Influence of hepatitis delta virus replication in the presence of hepatitis B virus DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The presence of hepatitis B virus DNA was studied in peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 259 HBsAg carriers (229 anti-hepatitis delta negative, 30 anti-hepatitis delta positive), 16 anti-HBc-positive HBsAg-negative patients and 30 patients without hepatitis B virus markers. Hepatitis B virus DNA sequences were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cell from 115 (44.4%) of the chronic HBsAg carriers and from two (12%) of the anti-HBc-positive, HBsAg-negative patients. In anti-hepatitis delta-negative patients, viral DNA was positive in peripheral blood mononuclear cell from 74 (46%) and from 24 (35.5%) with and without serum HBV-DNA, respectively. With respect to anti-hepatitis delta-positive patients, viral DNA was found in peripheral blood mononuclear cell in 8 of 13 (61.5%) of the patients with circulating hepatitis delta virus RNA and in 9 of 17 (53%) of the hepatitis delta virus RNA-negative subjects. Regarding hepatitis B virus DNA in serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell, 71% (5 of 7) of the patients with serum hepatitis B virus DNA had this marker in peripheral blood mononuclear cell, whereas 52% (12 of 23) of the patients without serum hepatitis B virus DNA had hepatitis B virus DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cell. A Southern blot analysis was also carried out on peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 30 patients. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in 16 patients as free forms, in 12 patients as dimers and free forms and as free circular together with free linear forms in the remaining two patients. 
1	Altered expression of the retinoblastoma gene product in human sarcomas. BACKGROUND. The retinoblastoma-susceptibility (Rb) gene is a prototype tumor-suppressor gene originally isolated from patients with heritable retinoblastoma. This gene encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein whose expression is altered in several types of human tumors. METHODS. We studied the expression of the Rb protein in 44 primary and 12 metastatic high-grade human sarcomas by means of immunohistochemical methods and Western blotting. Computerized image analysis was used to quantify the level of Rb gene product in individual tumor cells. The expression of the Rb gene was then correlated with clinical outcome in the patients with primary tumors. RESULTS. Of the 44 patients with primary sarcomas, 13 (30 percent) had tumors with normal, homogeneous expression of the Rb protein in essentially all tumor cells. Thirty-one patients with primary tumors (70 percent) had altered Rb expression; in 18 (40 percent) the Rb protein was heterogeneously expressed, and in 13 (30 percent) it was detected in fewer than 20 percent of the tumor cells. All 12 of the patients with metastatic sarcomas had altered expression of the Rb protein. When the findings in the patients with primary tumors were correlated with clinical outcome, survival was found to be significantly increased in the patients whose tumors had homogeneous Rb expression, as compared with those with either heterogeneous expression (P = 0.026) or no expression (P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS. Tumors in which the expression of Rb gene product was decreased were more aggressive than tumors in which this protein was expressed by nearly all cells. The Rb gene product may be an important prognostic variable in patients with these tumors. 
3	Functional outcome measures in stroke rehabilitation. I examine statistical considerations in the analysis of functional outcome following stroke and discuss the mathematical relation between improvement in function and discharge functional score. I demonstrate mathematically that the predictor variables of improvement and discharge functional score are the same and that the regression coefficients for improvement and discharge functional score will be equal, except for the admission functional score, for which a mathematically defined relation exists. I argue that the relation between admission functional score and discharge functional score must be positive and strong and that the relation between admission functional score and improvement must be negative for the stroke population. I believe that an ignorance of statistical concepts, especially confounding, and of the differences between raw correlations, partial correlations, and predictors have led to much confusion in functional outcome research. 
4	Hemodynamic determinants of subdiaphragmatic venous return during closed-chest CPR in a canine cardiac arrest model. OBJECTIVE: To assess the hemodynamic determinates of peripheral subdiaphragmatic venous-to-right-heart return during closed-chest CPR. MODEL: Seven anesthetized dogs subjected to electrically induced ventricular fibrillation for five minutes. INTERVENTIONS: Conventional closed-chest CPR and closed-chest CPR with continuous abdominal binding at a chest compression rate of 60 per minute, a compression-to-relaxation ratio of 50:50, and a ventilation-to-compression ratio of 1:5. METHODS: Solid-state catheters were positioned in the ascending aorta, right atrium (RA), and inferior vena cava (IVC). Cannulating electromagnetic flow probes were inserted into the IVC and a carotid artery. Analog-to-digital conversion was performed electronically. Five minutes after ventricular fibrillation was induced, interventions were performed in an alternating sequence. Systolic, diastolic, and mean pressures and flows were measured and compared. STATISTICAL METHODS: Two-tailed, unpaired t test applied to equal sample size, linear regression analysis, and multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Abdominal binding during CPR significantly increased (P less than .05) all measured systolic and diastolic CPR intravascular pressures compared with CPR without abdominal binding but did not affect IVC-to-right-heart venous return. During conventional CPR without abdominal binding, venous return was dependent on the diastolic IVC pressure (r = .86, P = .014), mean IVC pressure (r = .80, P = .03), and carotid blood flow (r = .99, P = .001) but not on the IVC-to-RA pressure gradient. With abdominal binding, venous return was not correlated with any study hemodynamic variable, including the peripheral venous-to-RA pressure gradient. CONCLUSION: Venous return from the subdiaphragmatic venous bed during CPR is dependent on venous pressure, not on the peripheral venous-to-right-heart pressure gradient. Abdominal binding during CPR does not affect venous return. Venous return during CPR diastole is highly dependent on central venous capacitance (left heart outflow during CPR systole). 
1	Bilateral familial carotid body paragangliomas. Report of a case with DNA flow cytometric and cytogenetic analyses. A case study of bilateral familial carotid body paragangliomas with DNA flow cytometric and cytogenetic analyses is presented. Analysis of tumor cell nuclear DNA content by flow cytometry revealed aneuploid cell populations in both tumors. Standard cytogenetic analysis (Giemsa-banding technique used) of the right carotid body paraganglioma showed no evidence of numerical or structural abnormalities. We describe parameters currently used to "predict" biological behavior in these tumors. 
3	Visuospatial impairment in Parkinson's disease. We explored the nature of the visuospatial deficit in Parkinson's disease (PD) and its progression as a function of disease duration. We compared the performance of 183 patients with idiopathic PD and 90 control subjects matched for age and education on six visuospatial measures. We divided patients into three groups according to the disease duration: early (1 to 4 years), middle (5 to 10 years), and advanced (greater than 10 years). Performance deteriorated in five of the six visuospatial measures, as a function of disease duration. However, the pattern of visuospatial decline depended on whether dementia was present. The results were not influenced by age or anticholinergic medication. These findings support the presence of visuospatial deficits in PD patients, with a changing pattern of impairment related to dementia and progression of the disease. 
5	Recurrent urethral stricture disease managed by clean intermittent self-catheterization. We studied 41 patients with urethral stricture who had failed at least 1 operation, and were being maintained with filiform and follower dilation every 6 to 12 weeks. The patients were instructed in clean intermittent self-catheterization with a 16F red rubber catheter, which was performed every 1 to 30 days. Followup from 9 to 36 months revealed excellent compliance and average peak uroflow rates increased from 5.5 cc per second before dilation to 17.1 cc per second at the last followup visit. Clean intermittent self-catheterization is a simple method to maintain a patent urethra and obviates the need for further operations or painful dilations. 
3	Long-term follow-up review of 31 children with severe closed head trauma. Thirty-one children aged 3 to 15 years were followed for 5 to 11 years after suffering severe closed head trauma which caused coma for 1 week or more (median duration of coma 3 weeks). One patient remained in a persistent vegetative state until his death 9 years later. The other 30 recovered consciousness and were discharged. All suffered diminution of their abilities, and 24 of them had major permanent disability. The most common motor disabilities were pure spastic hemiparesis (seven cases), basal ganglia syndromes (four cases), ataxia (three cases), and a combination of hemiparesis and ataxia (five cases). Of the 30 patients, 26 regained independent ambulation, seven were epileptic, and 14 were dysarthric in various degrees. Only 10 had the cognitive ability to profit from the normal educational system, and none had attempted postsecondary education. Social problems were common. The worst outcomes were associated with intracranial bleeding and/or brain contusion seen on computerized tomography (CT) scans at the acute stage; the best were associated with normal CT scans. The degree of residual disability in these children seems no less than that of adults with trauma of similar severity. 
4	Plaque and structural characteristics of the descending thoracic aorta using transesophageal echocardiography. The in vivo acoustic and structural characteristics of atherosclerosis in the descending thoracic aorta have not been well delineated. We prospectively evaluated the descending thoracic aorta of 147 patients (35 women and 112 men; age, 61 +/- 14 years) who underwent clinically indicated transesophageal echocardiography. Patients with suspected disease of the aorta were excluded. Thirty-eight patients (26%) had protruding plaques (men, 25%; women, 29%). Six patients had mobile intimal densities with the mobile area ranging up to 1 cm2. As expected, aortic lumen area was decreased (plaque-free, 3.53 cm2; plaque, 3.19 cm2; p less than 0.05) and wall area was increased (plaque-free, 1.51 cm2; plaque, 1.92 cm2; p less than 0.05) in the regions of the plaque. However, total arterial area was not increased (plaque-free, 5.04 cm2; plaque, 5.09 cm2; difference not significant) in a compensatory manner as observed in other arterial beds. Plaque gray scale was less than the gray scale of plaque-free wall (plaque-free, 141.2; plaque, 122.7; p less than 0.05) when compared at the same level of the descending thoracic aorta or with a second aortic plaque-free level (plaque-free, 150.4; plaque, 122.7; p less than 0.05). Standard deviation of gray scale level was similar between plaque and normal regions. Unsuspected protruding plaques in the descending thoracic aorta occurred in one quarter of the patients referred for routine transesophageal examination. Plaques tended to have lower echogenicity and were differentiated from plaque-free walls within patients. Plaque formation did not result in increased total arterial area. These data suggest that the degree or character of compensatory atherosclerotic remodeling in the highly elastic descending thoracic aorta may differ from other arterial beds. 
1	The value of push-type jejunal endoscopy in familial adenomatosis coli/Gardner's syndrome. Push-type jejunal endoscopy using a long forward-viewing duodenofiberscope was performed in 10 patients with familial adenomatosis coli/Gardner's syndrome. Jejunal polypoid lesions were detected in nine of the 10 patients (90%). The lesions appeared sessile, whitish, and measured 3 mm or less in diameter. Histologic findings of the biopsy specimens from these polypoid lesions revealed tubular adenoma in all nine patients. In addition, this method led to the detection of duodenal adenomas in one patient, in whom duodenofiberscopy with the side-viewing instrument revealed no polypoid lesions in the bulb and second portion of the duodenum. In view of these results, we recommend that push-type jejunal endoscopy, as well as side-viewing duodenofiberscopy, should be added to the usual preoperative examinations done in patients with this disease. 
1	Autologous antibodies eluted from membrane fragments in human ovarian epithelial neoplastic effusions. III. Cytotoxic potential in vitro and characterization of antigen(s). Cyst and ascites fluids from patients with ovarian epithelial neoplasms contain immunoglobulins with antitumor activity. Autologous antibodies bound to the cellular membrane fragments obtained from human ovarian neoplastic effusions react with cell-surface antigens on different human ovarian cell lines, surgical specimens of human ovarian adenocarcinoma, and human ovarian tumors grown in athymic Balb/c mice. The antibodies do not react with tissue preparations from normal human ovaries, other nonovarian normal or neoplastic tissues, and nonovarian human cell lines. These studies indicate that these antibodies are capable of complement-mediated lysis of human ovarian tumor cell lines in vitro. Preliminary characterization of the autologous ovarian tumor-associated antigen(s) indicates that it may be composed of three large-molecular-weight proteins of 182,000, 164,000, and 122,000 d. 
5	Postoperative ectopic craniopharyngioma. Case report. The case of an ectopic craniopharyngioma arising from a seed of tissue deposited along the operative track is reported. The uniqueness of this lesion is addressed. Ideal therapy and controversies regarding radiation therapy of craniopharyngiomas are discussed in light of this new variation in recurrence. 
1	Immunophenotyping in the management of gastric lymphoma. Primary gastric lymphoma is a rare tumor in which surgical resection plays a major role in improving the response rate and reducing the incidence of bleeding and perforation after chemotherapy. In 17 consecutive patients, the diagnosis of gastric lymphoma was made by immunophenotyping snap-frozen endoscopic biopsy specimens. All neoplasms were B-cell lymphomas. Pan B surface marker antigens were present in all patients. Levels of Ki-67, a nuclear marker of tumor proliferation, were greater than 45% in two of the four patients who died after progression of their lymphoma. All patients alive had Ki-67 levels of less than 30%. A lower proliferation index, as measured by Ki-67, appears to be associated with better prognosis. Ten of 11 patients treated by resection prior to chemotherapy had no complications. Immunophenotyping is the key in the differential diagnosis when considering malignant lymphoma with gastric carcinoma and benign conditions such as pseudolymphoma. 
4	Ultrasonographic diagnosis of a large placental intervillous thrombosis associated with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level. A placental lesion associated with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level and a positive Kleihauer-Betke test is reported. Serial ultrasonograms showed a progressive increase in the echogenicity of the lesion that corresponded to a large intervillous thrombosis after delivery. This case illustrates the importance of detailed ultrasonographic and pathologic placental investigations in pregnancies with unexplained elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein. 
1	Questionable role of CNS radioprophylaxis in the therapeutic management of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma with meningeal extension. A series of 15 consecutive children with head and neck nonorbital rhabdomyosarcoma (RMSA) with meningeal extension were prospectively treated with chemotherapy consisting of Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratory, Columbus, OH) (ADM), vincristine (VCR), cyclophosphamide (CPM), and dactinomycin (DACT) followed by radiotherapy (60 Gy) to the primary tumor volume, along with intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX). Thirteen of 15 responded to preradiation chemotherapy. Four of 13 relapsed. Relapse occurred at the level of the primary tumor in three of four. The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 59%, similar to that achieved in a previous series treated with a comparable therapeutic approach that also included whole-brain radiotherapy as a prophylaxis of possible occult meningeal seeding. It is concluded that CNS prophylaxis with radiotherapy is questionable in the management of childhood RMSA with meningeal extension. 
1	Expression of beta 1 integrins in normal human keratinocytes. The majority of cell adhesive events to the extracellular matrix are mediated by cell surface receptors, beta 1 integrins. Keratinocytes express at least six different polypeptides of beta 1 integrin class, namely beta 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and alpha 6 (alpha 6 is mainly associated with beta 4 polypeptide). These epithelial cells use alpha 2 beta 1 as a collagen receptor and alpha 3 beta 1 as a fibronectin receptor, while alpha 6 beta 4 is the major basement membrane receptor. Expression of alpha 5 beta 1 complex is low. Processing of beta 1 integrins is fast in keratinocytes; half-maximal maturation takes only 3 hours. In addition to their function in cell-matrix interactions, beta 1 integrins (alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 3 beta 1) have also a role in maintaining keratinocyte cell-cell interactions. It is possible that resting basal keratinocytes use beta 1 integrins as cell-cell adhesion receptors, and during activation, like in wound healing, these receptors relocalize to mediate events involving cell-matrix interactions. 
3	Long-term efficacy of primary laser trabeculoplasty. Sixty glaucomatous eyes of 60 patients treated with laser trabeculoplasty as primary therapy were reviewed retrospectively. There were 42 eyes with capsular glaucoma and 18 with simple glaucoma. The mean prelaser intraocular pressure (IOP) was 35.2 (SD = 6.5) mmHg. Success was defined as IOP less than or equal to 22 mmHg without medication. The probability of success was 0.73 at 1 year, 0.66 at 2 years, 0.57 at 3 years, and 0.50 at 4 years. Three eyes experienced progressive visual field loss or disc damage in spite of an intraocular pressure below 22 mmHg without medication. High prelaser pressure and the severity of the visual field defects were significant predictors of treatment failure. 
5	Cluster of fulminant hepatitis B in crack users. Fulminant hepatitis occurs in only 1% of acute hepatitis B patients, requiring hospitalization, but coinfection with delta virus increases the incidence. Hepatitis B and D infection are commonly associated with intravenous drug abuse, but there have been no previous reports of an association with nonparenteral cocaine. Crack use, via sexual promiscuity, is associated with an increased risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection, but has never been associated with viral hepatitis. We report four fatal cases of fulminant hepatitis B including, one with delta virus coinfection and one with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, in young, sexually active, heterosexual crack users. These patients denied a history of intravenous drug abuse. Our patients probably contracted hepatitis B infection via heterosexual contact. Chronic cocaine exposure may or may not have contributed to the fulminant outcome. Crack users may be at increased risk of developing hepatitis B and D infection. Epidemiological studies are needed to evaluate their risk of viral hepatitis and the effect of cocaine on its outcome. 
5	Oxygen uptake and heart rate responses during hypoxic exercise in children and adults. Control of ventilation and heart rate during exercise appears to undergo maturation, while aerobic metabolism (VO2) may not. Since we had previously found that hypoxia during exercise produced different ventilatory responses in children (C) compared to adults (A), we hypothesized that VO2 and heart rate kinetics during exercise would show similar maturational responses to hypoxia. To test this hypothesis, we examined the responses during progressive (ramp) and constant work rate tests in children and adults breathing either room air or hypoxic gas (FiO2 = 0.15). When corrected for body weight, children and adults had similar values for lactic acidosis threshold (LAT) (C: 29.1 +/- 5.0 ml.min-1.kg-1; A: 27.9 +/- 4.3) and VO2max (C: 40.7 +/- 8.6 ml.min-1.kg-1; A: 45.2 +/- 6.7) during normoxia. Hypoxia significantly lowered LAT (C: 27.5 +/- 5.4 ml.min-1.kg-1; A: 23.2 +/- 3.8; both P less than 0.05) and VO2max (C: 37.7 +/- 8.3 ml.min-1.kg-1; A: 40.1 +/- 5.3; both P less than 0.05) in both children and adults. Metabolic efficiency (delta VO2/delta work rate) and the VO2-heart rate relationship (delta VO2/delta HR/kg) were similar in the two groups and unaffected by hypoxia. During the constant work rate exercise, VO2 kinetics (time constant during phase 2 of the response (pi 1) and the O2 deficit) were similar between children and adults and were significantly slowed by hypoxia, consistent with current understanding of the control of oxidative metabolism. Finally, heart rate was increased at rest and during exercise with hypoxia, while the time to reach 75% of the end-exercise response was delayed significantly, in both groups. 
1	Cutaneous horn of the penis: its association with squamous cell carcinoma and HPV-16 infection. Cutaneous horns of the penis are rare. Including this case, only 19 cases have been reported in the English-language literature. In 37% of the reported cases a malignant tumor was found beneath the cutaneous horn. Our case is remarkable because a stage I squamous cell carcinoma developed on the shaft of the penis of a neonatally circumcised man. Human genital carcinoma resulting from a multifactorial process in which "promoting" papillomavirus is an integral element is being increasingly reported. We review the relationship of circumcision to genital human papillomavirus infection and their synergism in the development of squamous cell carcinoma. 
4	Hypertension with concomitant conditions: the changing role of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Hypertension often is associated with concomitant conditions such as chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and peripheral vascular disease. Moreover, other cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemias and abnormalities of glucose and insulin metabolism, are common in patients with hypertension. Conventional beta-blockers used for antihypertensive therapy can have adverse effects in patients with airway disease, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease, and can exaggerate the other risk factors. Newer beta-blockers such as celiprolol, which have selective partial agonist activity expressed at beta 2-receptors, appear to avoid these problems. Celiprolol exhibits antianginal and antihypertensive efficacy without adversely effecting left ventricular systolic function or exercise performance. It also may cause regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. The stimulatory action of celiprolol on vascular beta 2-receptors enhances regional flow and may increase walking distance in patients with claudication. The reduction in renal vascular resistance demonstrated by this drug is associated with preservation of renal blood flow and function. Spirometric measurements of airway function are unchanged during celiprolol treatment. Similarly, there are no adverse effects on lipid or glucose concentrations. These new developments in beta-blocker pharmacology indicate that this class of agents could be used in patients with hypertension with concomitant diseases or risk factors other than high blood pressure. 
2	Human T cell lymphotropic virus infection in Guaymi Indians from Panama. Preliminary studies found that 9% of Guaymi Indians from Bocas del Toro province have antibody to human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I/II). The present study enrolled 317 (21% of the population) Guaymi Indians from Changuinola, the capital of Bocas del Toro province and 333 (70% of the population) from Canquintu, an isolated rural village. Demographic information and family relationships were ascertained and subjects were screened for neurologic diseases. Serum specimens were screened by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HTLV-I/II antibody and positives were confirmed according to U.S. Public Health Service criteria. Twenty-five (8%) Guaymi residing in Changuinola and 7 (2.1%) from Canquintu were confirmed seropositive. In Changuinola, antibody was virtually limited to residents greater than or equal to 15 years of age (24 [16%] of 153) and rates were slightly higher in males than in females; in Canquintu, antibody rates did not increase significantly with age and appeared higher in females than in males. In Changuinola, there was no evidence for household clustering of infection. In contrast, HTLV antibody among Canquintu residents clustered significantly by household. HTLV-associated neurologic disease was not detected in either population. The atypical seroepidemiology observed in both locations might be explained if the virus endemic to the Guaymi differed from HTLV-I previously described in the Caribbean basin and Japan. 
2	Significance of anti-HBx antibodies in hepatitis B virus infection. Serological responses to hepatitis B virus-X determinants have been noted in human sera, but conflicting findings concerning the correlation of anti-HBx antibodies with different stages of hepatitis B virus infection or pathological sequelae have been reported. Using an adenovirus-based eukaryotic vector, the 17 kD X protein was efficiently expressed in 293 cells. Cellular extracts containing the eukaryotic X protein have been used to screen for anti-HBx antibodies by immunoblot analysis in a large panel of sera from patients affected by hepatitis B virus chronic hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma and acute viral hepatitis. Sera from 32 of 171 (19%) chronic hepatitis B virus patients were positive for anti-HBx antibodies. Only one of thirty-two (3%) HBsAg-negative, anti-HBs/anti-HBc-positive chronic hepatitis serum was anti-HBx positive. Very few sera from primary hepatocellular carcinoma patients showed positivity for anti-HBx (8 of 149 or 5%). Anti-HBx were also detected in 8 of 48 (17%) acute viral hepatitis patients. In the four cases that were followed up weekly, anti-HBx antibodies appeared 3 to 4 wk after the onset of the clinical signs. To compare the X protein expressed in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells as a substrate for anti-HBx antibody detection, 171 sera were screened with HBx fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. The prokaryotic cell extract test seems to be more sensitive. During the chronic phase of hepatitis B virus infection, the presence of anti-HBx antibodies detected with the eukaryotic cell extract correlates with the presence of well-established markers of ongoing viral replication: serum hepatitis B virus-DNA (p less than 0.001) and intrahepatic HBcAg expression (p less than 0.001). 
4	Pulmonary vascular steal in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. After pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, performed for relief of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, perfusion lung scans have frequently disclosed new perfusion defects in segments served by undissected pulmonary arteries. Our hypotheses were that these new postoperative defects occurred with great frequency and did not represent postoperative vessel occlusion. We retrospectively reviewed the preoperative and postoperative perfusion scans of 33 consecutive patients undergoing pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. New postoperative perfusion defects were noted in 23 of 33 patients. The incidence of new defects was increased tenfold in segments that had (1) normal preoperative angiographic findings, (2) normal preoperative radionuclide perfusion, and (3) not been entered at the time of surgery. Postoperative angiograms, available in 15 of 33 patients, documented the nonembolic, nonocclusive nature of the new perfusion scan defects. The most plausible alternate explanation for this previously undescribed finding is a redistribution of pulmonary arterial resistance induced by the thromboendarterectomy, namely, a pulmonary vascular "steal.". 
2	Two cases of adult T-cell leukemia associated with acute pancreatitis due to hypercalcemia. We report two cases of adult T-cell leukemia associated with acute pancreatitis and hypercalcemia. After sudden onset of epigastralgia, acute pancreatitis and hypercalcemia were found in both patients. There were no diseases that could explain the acute pancreatitis except for hypercalcemia probably due to adult T-cell leukemia. Thus we considered that hypercalcemia due to adult T-cell leukemia had led to acute pancreatitis. This is the first report of such a complication in adult T-cell leukemia. 
3	Evolution of energy expenditure and nitrogen excretion in severe head-injured patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the influence of therapeutic changes on the level of energy expenditure (EE) and N excretion in a homogeneous group of patients usually considered hypermetabolic. DESIGN: EE and N excretion of head-injured patients were measured simultaneously at phases 1 and 2 (patients treated 4 +/- 3 and 18 +/- 8 days after injury, respectively). SETTING: Acute care hospital. PATIENTS: Eight severe head-injured patients, mean weight 63.1 +/- 6.1 (SD) kg, mean age 21 +/- 3.8 (SD) yr. INTERVENTIONS: At phase 1, all patients were sedated with fentanyl (6.7 +/- 1.9 micrograms/kg.hr) plus flunitrazepam (9.1 +/- 4.8 micrograms/kg.hr) and were mechanically ventilated. All patients received continuous total parenteral nutrition. The nonprotein caloric intake averaged 1092 +/- 200 kcal/day, including 77% glucose and 23% fat (Intralipid 20%). The total N intake averaged 7 +/- 5 g/day, consisting of crystalline amino acids. At phase 2, no patient received any sedative and all were breathing spontaneously via tracheostomy. All patients received parenteral and/or enteral nutrition. The nonprotein caloric intake averaged 1929 +/- 200 kcal/day consisting of 65% carbohydrates and 35% fat. The total N intake averaged 13 +/- 2 g/day. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The EE was significantly higher at phase 2 than at phase 1 (2121 vs. 1737 kcal), but the interindividual variability was low at both phases. N excretion was high at the two periods of the study and not correlated to the level of EE. The RQ was 0.75 at both periods, indicating predominant fat oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: We could not demonstrate any parallelism in the evolution of EE and protein catabolism in head-injured patients. The therapeutics (mechanical ventilation, sedation, and nutrition) have a major effect on EE but little on N excretion. 
5	Role of nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy for clinical stage B2 prostate cancer. To examine the role of nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy in patients with clinical stage B2 prostate cancer we reviewed the first 77 such patients in our series since we adopted the nerve-sparing technique. A total of 47 patients (61%) underwent bilateral and 26 (34%) underwent unilateral nerve-sparing prostatectomy, while in 4 (5%) both neurovascular bundles were resected. Among the patients followed for 12 months 27 of 41 (66%) treated with bilateral and 7 of 19 (37%) treated with unilateral nerve-sparing prostatectomy had potency preserved. With the strict clinicopathological criteria of organ-confined tumor, that is intracapsular tumor with negative surgical margins and undetectable postoperative prostate specific antigen levels, complete tumor excision was achieved in 17 patients (36%) treated with bilateral and 7 of 26 (27%) treated with unilateral nerve-sparing prostatectomy. All patients in whom both neurovascular bundles were resected had pathological stage C or D1 disease. Of the 24 patients who had complete tumor excision by the strict criteria only 15 (19.5% of the 77 preoperatively potent patients) had potency preserved. Of these patients 19 had microscopically positive margins without seminal vesicle invasion (pathological stage C1) with undetectable postoperative prostate specific antigen levels. In addition, 4 patients had seminal vesicle involvement with negative surgical margins and undetectable postoperative prostate specific antigen levels. If these patients also are considered as having complete tumor excision, there was an over-all complete tumor excision rate of 61% (47 of 77), of whom 25 (32% of the 77 patients) had preservation of potency. Ten patients with clinical stage B2 tumor whose potency was preserved had histological and serological evidence of incomplete tumor excision. Of 53 patients with pathological stage C1 disease 9 (17%) had margins positive only in the regions of the neurovascular bundles. Preoperative prostate specific antigen and acid phosphatase levels, and findings on transrectal ultrasonography failed to predict accurately which patients had extracapsular tumor extension. Patients with poorly differentiated tumors and/or bulky disease on rectal examination had a higher incidence of extracapsular extension and positive margins. We conclude that in the majority of potent patients with clinical stage B2 prostate cancer not all of the goals of nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy are realized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
5	Macrophages stimulate bone resorption when they phagocytose particles. We investigated in vitro a mechanism by which particulate debris may induce bone resorption and cause implant loosening. We first studied two standard particles: latex, which is considered to be inert, and zymosan, which is inflammatory. Macrophages that phagocytosed either particle became activated, and stimulated 15 times as much bone resorption as did control macrophages. For activation to occur, 100 times more latex than zymosan had to be phagocytosed. We also found that bone cement and polyethylene particles activated macrophages in a similar manner, and that the necessary amounts of these were intermediate between those of latex and zymosan. None of the particles were toxic. It was concluded that implant loosening may result from bone resorption stimulated by mediators released by macrophages that have phagocytosed particles of bone cement or polyethylene. 
4	Exercise echocardiography and technetium-99m MIBI single-photon emission computed tomography in the detection of coronary artery disease. To compare the relative diagnostic value of exercise echocardiography with perfusion technetium-99m metoxyisobutylisonitrile single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in detecting coronary artery disease (CAD), 75 patients with suspected CAD but a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) at rest were included in a prospective correlative study. Both the exercise echocardiograms and SPECT studies were performed in conjunction with the same symptom-limited bicycle exercise test. The development of either a new wall motion abnormality or a reversible perfusion defect after exercise, or both, were regarded as a positive test for the exercise echocardiographic and SPECT studies, respectively. The results of these 2 diagnostic tests were compared with coronary arteriography. Exercise echocardiography identified 35 (71%) and SPECT 41 (84%, p = 0.13) of the 49 patients with significant CAD (defined as greater than 50% diameter stenosis). Twenty-five of the 26 patients (96%) without significant coronary stenosis had negative exercise echocardiographic results and 23 of 26 (88%) had negative SPECT results. Exercise-induced new wall motion abnormalities showed a good correlation with reversible perfusion defects, and the results of the 2 methods were concordant in 65 of 75 patients (agreement = 88%, kappa = 0.75 +/- 0.14). Both the diagnostic accuracy of exercise echocardiography and SPECT were significantly higher than the exercise ECG (81 vs 64%, p less than 0.02 and 88 vs 64%, p less than 0.005). The sensitivity and specificity for detecting individual diseased vessels were 60 and 95% for exercise echocardiography and 67 and 94% for SPECT. 
2	Transient mitral regurgitation due to mitral valve prolapse accompanied by systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. A grade 4/6 systolic murmur, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM), and severe mitral regurgitation (MR) documented by two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography developed suddenly on the structurally normal heart of a patient with idiopathic portal hypertension. The patient did not have signs of congestive heart failure and the aforementioned phenomenon disappeared completely when the patient was in hepatic failure. This could be explained by a change in circulating blood volume either by gastrointestinal hemorrhage or hepatic failure. 
5	Acute hypervolaemia increases gastroduodenal resistance to the flow of liquid in the rat. The effect of volume expansion of extracellular fluid on gastroduodenal resistance to the flow of isotonic saline was assessed in three groups of rats using intravenous infusions of isotonic, isotonic-isoncotic, and isotonic-isoncotic-isohaemic solutions. The gastroduodenal segment of 29 male Wistar rats was barostatically perfused at a constant pressure gradient of 4 cm H2O and changes in flow (ml/minute) were taken as a reflection of changes in gastroduodenal resistance. Isotonic expansion led to a 33% drop in gastroduodenal flow compared with the normovolaemic period in the same animals (p less than 0.01). Extracellular fluid expansion with isotonic-isoncotic and isotonic-isoncotic-isohaemic solutions was associated with reductions in gastroduodenal flow of 29% (p less than 0.05) and 31% (p less than 0.01) respectively. The increase in gastroduodenal resistance is due to hypervolaemia per se and not to haemodilution, decreases in plasma oncotic pressure, or electrolyte imbalance. The effect of hypervolaemia on gastroduodenal resistance, which was reversed by small haemorrhages (0.5-1.0 ml per 100 g body weight), may be due to changes in tonus or phasic motor activity, or both, and may be part of the homeostatic processes that help the organism minimise liquid volume excess. 
5	Final height in boys with untreated constitutional delay in growth and puberty. To determine the natural history and psychological impact of the growth pattern in boys with constitutional delay in growth and puberty (CDGP), 43 boys presenting with short stature due to CDGP were followed up to final height. At presentation mean (SD) chronological age was 14.0 (1.9) years, bone age delay 2.7 (1.0) years, standing height standard deviation score (SDS) -3.4 (0.6), and predicted adult height SDS -1.3 (0.7). Final adult height SDS was -1.6 (0.9), measured at 21.2 (2.6) years. There was no significant difference between final height and predicted adult height, but there was a significant difference between final height and measured mid-parental height. Psychological questionnaires showed no significant difference in self esteem, marital, or employment state between the CDGP group and a control group. There was no correlation between self esteem and final height, but 25 felt their growth delay had affected their success either at school, work, or socially and 20 would rather have had treatment to advance their growth spurt. This study supports the more frequent use of active medical treatment to advance growth in boys with CDGP, and shows that although boys with CDGP reach their predicted heights, this is short for their families. 
3	Paraesthesia with lumbar epidural catheters. A comparison of air and saline in a loss-of-resistance technique. The epidural space was located in 32 obstetric patients using loss of resistance to air, while in a further 35 saline was used. The incidence of paraesthesia was 56% in the air group and 57% in the saline group. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of other complications or in the quality of analgesia provided. 
3	Effects of MK-801 on recovery from sensorimotor cortex lesions. Histologic evidence suggests that drugs acting as noncompetitive antagonists at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor can have beneficial or pathologic effects on central nervous system neurons. In the present experiments we examined the effects of MK-801 on recovery of behavioral function after unilateral lesions in the rat somatic sensorimotor cortex. In the first experiment, rats with unilateral sensorimotor cortex lesions were given either MK-801 (1 mg/kg) or saline 12-16 hours after surgery. Additional injections were given on postoperative days 2, 4, and 6. Behavioral tests measured somatosensory asymmetries (i.e., bilateral tactile stimulation tests) and forelimb placing. After creation of sensorimotor cortex lesions, rats showed an ipsilateral somatosensory bias and an impairment in placing the contralateral forelimb. Rats treated with MK-801 recovered slightly faster than saline-treated animals as measured by a bilateral tactile stimulation test (p less than 0.05). In contrast, there was no significant difference between the groups in the recovery of forelimb placing. In a second experiment, rats with sensorimotor cortex lesions were treated with a single injection of MK-801 after behavioral recovery. Twenty hours after the MK-801 injection, rats with sensorimotor cortex lesions showed a reinstatement of the placing deficits. The impairment endured for at least 7 days after injection. These behavioral data support the idea that MK-801 can have either beneficial or detrimental effects when administered after brain damage. 
4	Spinal extradural cavernous hemangioma. Three cases of isolated spinal extradural cavernous hemangiomas are reported, two in the thoracic and one in the lumbar region. One of them manifested as acute cord compression, the other two as chronic progressive myelopathy or radiculopathy. A total excision or subtotal excision with irradiation was performed. All of them had good functional recovery. The clinical picture, radiological diagnosis, and optimal method of treatment are discussed. The relevant literature is reviewed. 
5	Cerebral infarction: early detection by means of contrast-enhanced cerebral arteries at MR imaging. The authors describe a new magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sign of acute cerebral ischemia/infarction. Abnormally contrast material-enhanced curvilinear structures were demonstrated in eight patients in the evolving area of cerebral ischemia/infarction within 26 hours after the ictus on contrast-enhanced, high-field-strength (1.5-T), T1-weighted spin-echo images. The abnormal enhancement is considered to represent cortical arterial vessels of markedly slowed circulation in areas of underlying brain injury, which will eventually progress to frank brain infarction. This was demonstrated at computed tomographic (CT) and follow-up MR examinations. Characteristically, the degree of the contrast enhancement of vessels appeared most intense in the proximal portions, and the intensity of enhancement gradually diminished in the more distal portions of these vessels as they pass over the convexities and finally disappear. 
5	Characterization of a rat pancreatic secretory protein associated with pancreatitis. A new protein was purified from the pancreatic juice of rats with acute pancreatitis. That protein, not detectable in control animals, was called "pancreatitis-associated protein." It was first observed 6 hours after induction of experimental pancreatitis with taurocholate or cerulein, reached maximal levels of 45 micrograms/mg protein in zymogen granules and 1.8 micrograms/mg protein in pancreatic tissue during the acute phase (48 hours), and disappeared during recovery (day 5). It was never detected in spleen, liver, kidney, heart, or lung. The detection limit of the assay system was 12 ng/mg protein, so that pancreatitis-associated protein levels increased at least 100-fold in pancreatic tissue during the acute phase. The molecular weight (12,000) and isoelectric point (8.2) were determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Subcellular fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy showed that the protein was synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum and stored in zymogen granules before being secreted, similar to other pancreatic secretory proteins. Immunoblotting and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that the same protein was synthesized upon induction of pancreatitis by cerulein infusion, by retrograde injection of bile acids, or pancreatitis induced by pancreatic surgery. The pancreatitis-associated protein is therefore an acute-phase protein that differs from other proteins of that family because of its exocrine nature. 
5	Outpatient management of burns in children. The majority of burn wound management can be performed on an outpatient basis by the primary care physician or emergency physician. The physician, however, needs to know when to refer the patient for surgical evaluation and must be reasonably certain that the family will be compliant with wound care and follow-up. Fire prevention counselling still remains one of the most important aspects of burn management. 
4	Admission and mid-stay MedisGroups scores as predictors of death within 30 days of hospital admission. We examined the ability of MedisGroups, a severity measure based on clinical data abstracted from the medical record, to predict mortality 30 days following admission. MedisGroups measures severity both on admission and approximately one week into the hospital stay. The data base was a random sample of 20,985 admissions of Medicare beneficiaries with one of six conditions from 833 hospitals in seven states between January 1985 and May 1986. In all six conditions, higher admission and mid-stay severity scores were generally associated with higher risk of death. Across the six conditions, the R-squared values for predicting death using admission scores ranged from 0.01 to 0.16; R-squared values using mid-stay scores ranged from 0.03 to 0.34; and R-squared values from combining admission and mid-stay scores ranged from 0.05 to 0.41. Admission MedisGroups score was thus only modestly predictive of 30-day mortality. While the mid-stay score was more powerful, it may not be an appropriate severity adjuster to screen for quality using hospital mortality rates because it could be influenced by substandard care. 
4	Comparison of SPECT using technetium-99m agents and thallium-201 and PET for the assessment of myocardial perfusion and viability. This report reviews the applications of tomographic imaging with current and new tracers in assessing myocardial perfusion and viability. Multiple studies with thallium-201 (TI-201) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) have demonstrated high sensitivity, high rates of normalcy and high reproducibility. In assessing viability, fixed defects are frequently detected in viable zones in 4-hour studies with TI-201 imaging. Redistribution imaging performed 18 to 72 hours after injection or reinjection of TI-201 before 4-hour redistribution imaging has been shown to improve accuracy of viability assessment. TI-201 SPECT studies are limited by the suboptimal physical properties of TI-201, which result in variable image quality. The 2 new technetium-99m (Tc-99m) - labeled myocardial perfusion tracers offer the ability to inject much higher amounts of radioactivity, making it possible to assess ventricular function as well as myocardial perfusion from the same injection of radiotracer. Tc-99m sestamibi has very slow myocardial clearance, which allows for prolonged imaging time and results in image quality superior to that obtained with TI-201 and Tc-99m teboroxime. The combination of minimal redistribution of Tc-99m sestamibi and high count rates makes gated SPECT imaging feasible, and also permits assessment of patients with acute ischemic syndromes by uncoupling the time of injection from the time of imaging. The combination of high image quality and first-pass exercise capabilities may lead to a choice of this agent over TI-201 for assessment of chronic CAD. 
5	Clinical and instrumental evaluation of sensory function before and after percutaneous anterolateral cordotomy at cervical level in man. Sensory perception thresholds were assessed by clinical testing and by quantitative instrumental testing before and after operation in 16 subjects for whom unilateral percutaneous cervical cordotomy was performed for the relief of pain due to malignant disease, and compared with clinical assessments of sensory function. We were able to confirm the association between deficit in pin-prick sensation and pain relief in the majority of instances, though the completeness or otherwise of pain relief does not correspond to absence of pin-prick sensation. There is no objective interference with low threshold mechanical sensation as measured instrumentally, although cordotomised subjects do not experience startle, tickle, or cutaneous erotic sensation when subjected to appropriate low intensity tactile sensation. Quantitative instrumental testing shows that the greatest deficits produced by cordotomy are in the sensations of skinfold pinch (? = tissue-damage pain) and skin cooling. The latter is transduced in the periphery by A delta fibres; sensations of warmth and hot pain, transduced by primary afferent C fibres, are much less significantly affected. Our findings thus fail to resolve the question as to whether chronic clinical pain is mainly an A delta- or a C fibre-mediated phenomenon. 
5	Splicing defect at the ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) locus in gyrate atrophy. Gyrate atrophy (GA), a recessive eye disease involving progressive vision loss due to chorioretinal degeneration, is associated with the deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), with consequent hyperornithinemia. We and others have reported a number of missense mutations at the OAT locus which result in GA. Here we report a GA patient of Danish/Swedish ancestry in whom one OAT allele produces an mRNA that is missing a single 96-bp exon relative to the normal mRNA. Polymerase-chain-reaction amplification and sequencing revealed a 9-bp deletion covering the splice acceptor region of exon 5, resulting in the absence of exon 5 sequences from the mRNA with no disruption to the reading frame. This mutation, which was not present in 15 other independent GA patients, adds to the array of allelic heterogeneity observed in GA and represents the first example of a splicing mutation associated with this disorder. 
3	Results of treatment of displaced patellar fractures by partial patellectomy. The results of partial patellectomy as a treatment for displaced patellar fractures were assessed retrospectively with use of clinical, radiographic, and isokinetic strength-testing criteria. Forty patients who had been followed for an average of 8.4 years were studied. In the extremity that had been operated on, the mean active range of motion was 94 per cent, the circumference of the thigh was 100 per cent, and the strength of the quadriceps was 85 per cent of these measurements in the contralateral extremity. The over-all result was rated as excellent in twenty patients, good in eleven, fair in six, and poor in three. There was a significant statistical correlation between the type of fracture and the outcome. The results of this study indicate that partial patellectomy can be an effective treatment for selected patellar fractures. 
4	Inability to demonstrate physiologic correlates of subjective improvement among patients taught the relaxation response. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the regular elicitation of the relaxation response produces sustained physiologic changes coincident with symptomatic relief or improved psychological state. DESIGN: Prospective, cohort pilot study. SETTING: Clinical research center within a teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Thirteen athletic men, mean age 44.8 years, with borderline or labile hypertension, taking no medication. All 13 completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: Three baseline assessments of psychological state, symptom checklist, and assessment of autonomic response to infusion of beta agonist (isoproterenol). Daily relaxation response exercises for five consecutive weeks followed by repeat assessment of all parameters. Discontinuation of relaxation exercises for subsequent five weeks followed by repeat assessment of all parameters. Measurements and main results: After eliciting the relaxation response, subjects demonstrated significant decreases in anxiety (p less than 0.014) and somatic symptoms (p less than 0.02). Psychological and somatic variables returned toward baseline after the subsequent discontinuation of relaxation exercises. No significant concomitant change in urinary catecholamines, heart rate response to isoproterenol, blood pressure, pulse rate, or serum cholesterol was demonstrated. CONCLUSION: The regular elicitation of the relaxation response can improve psychological performance and reduce symptoms. However, the physiologic mechanism whereby these psychological and symptomatic improvements occur remains poorly understood and warrants further investigation. 
1	A palmar dermatosis linked to occult carcinoma of the upper thorax, head and neck: Bazex's syndrome and tripe palm. An unusual, persistent, corregated-to-honeycombed thickening of the palms accompanied by tenderness around the fingernails was found to be a cutaneous marker for internal malignancy. This combination of signs and symptoms has been reported under two clinical entities: Bazex's syndrome and tripe palm. This paraneoplastic syndrome is of interest to head and neck surgeons due to the location of the primary tumor, the site of metastatic disease, and the ability to cure the cutaneous disease by surgical removal of the primary tumor. In our patient, a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung not detectable on chest x-ray presented as a cervical mass accompanied by cutaneous changes on the palms and fingernails. Recognition of the relationship of the dermatologic changes to malignancy of a specific body region eventually led to the detection of the primary tumor. The characteristics of these paraneoplastic syndromes were reviewed in this report. 
1	Possible etiologic heterogeneity of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. A correlation of pathologic characteristics with human papillomavirus detection by in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. A correlated histopathologic and molecular virologic study of 30 cases of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 3 (VIN 3) and six associated invasive vulvar carcinomas was performed. Paraffin sections were examined for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18 by in situ hybridization for viral transcripts and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for amplification of HPV and of the beta-globin gene. Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 3 was histologically subclassified into warty (bowenoid) (20 cases) and basaloid (undifferentiated) (ten cases) types. Warty VIN characteristically was composed of squamous cells displaying abnormal proliferation and maturation and an undulating or spiked surface creating a "condylomatous" appearance whereas basaloid VIN had a smooth surface and was composed of undifferentiated basaloid cells resembling carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Human papillomavirus-16 was the only type detected in 16 of 30 VIN 3 and in five of six invasive carcinomas. The HPV-positive women were younger than HPV-negative women (mean age at diagnosis, 49 versus 60 years), their lesions more frequently demonstrated koilocytotic atypia (94% versus 43%), and they were more likely to have warty compared with basaloid VIN lesions (65% versus 30%). These findings suggest that there are at least two different types of VIN which have differing clinical, pathologic, and viral profiles. 
3	Fetal homotransplants (ventral mesencephalon and adrenal tissue) to the striatum of parkinsonian subjects. Fetal ventral mesencephalon and fetal adrenal tissue grafted to the caudate nucleus of four and three parkinsonian patients, respectively, have been shown to be an alternative treatment for the amelioration of the signs of the disease. The ventral mesencephalon patients had a significant amelioration of rigidity, bradykinesia, postural imbalance, gait disturbance, and facial expression. Three of these four patients have returned to work. The fatal adrenal group only showed amelioration of rigidity and bradykinesia. Though these patients are now able to perform their basic daily living activities, and one of them has renewed her household tasks, the other two have not yet been able to return to work. The differences observed between the ventral mesencephalon- and the fetal adrenal-transplanted patients may be related to the heterogeneity of their disease and/or the type of graft implanted. However encouraging our results may be, this experimental procedure obviously requires further studies, and should not be practiced outside of highly qualified clinical research centers. 
4	Infectious intracranial aneurysms: comparison of groups with and without endocarditis. A series of 12 patients with infectious intracranial aneurysms is presented, and a number of unusual features of the disorder are emphasized. A comparison of characteristics of the aneurysms and clinical course is made between patients with and without infective endocarditis. Most of the unusual characteristics of infectious aneurysms, including rare locations, causative organisms, and predisposing medical conditions, occurred in the group without endocarditis. The relationship of atypical features of infectious aneurysms to the etiology of aneurysm formation is discussed, and an approach to treatment is presented. 
5	Intrathoracic current flow during transthoracic defibrillation in dogs. Transcardiac current fraction. To achieve transcardiac threshold current during transthoracic defibrillation, a considerably larger current must be delivered to the thorax to compensate for the shunting effect of the lungs, the thoracic cage, and other elements of the torso. This shunting effect is thus an important determinant of transthoracic defibrillation threshold and can be quantified by the transcardiac current fraction (FC, the ratio of transcardiac to transthoracic threshold currents). Previous estimates of FC have ranged from as low as 3% to as high as 45%. The purpose of of this study was to quantify both FC and the major intrathoracic current pathways. Transthoracic and intrathoracic voltages and currents were simultaneously measured during high-voltage transthoracic shocks in 20 dogs. With correction factors determined from another set of 12 dogs, these raw data were corrected to compensate for field distortion caused by the presence of the intrathoracic electrodes, and the adjusted data were fit to a resistive network model. The results showed that 82% of the transthoracic current was shunted by the thoracic cage, while 14% was shunted by the lungs. The remaining 4% (FC) is the portion that passed through the heart. There was good agreement between the two independent methods used to calculate FC. Analysis based on the model indicated that FC was 3.7%, whereas FC determined by direct measurement with calibrated electrodes was 4.2%. Therefore, the results of this study, in contrast to earlier estimates of FC, show that defibrillation in dogs is achieved by only 4% of the total transthoracic current. 
4	Left ventricular end-systolic stress-volume index ratio in aortic and mitral regurgitation with normal ejection fraction. To evaluate the left ventricular contractile state in regurgitant valvular disease with normal ejection fraction, we analyzed the end-systolic stress-volume index relationship (ESSVR) by means of cineangiography in 15 normal subjects, 11 patients with aortic regurgitation (AR), and 10 patients with mitral regurgitation (MR) whose ejection fraction (EF) was 60% or more. The end-systolic stress-volume index ratio in normal subjects was 5.57 +/- 0.60 kdyne/cm5/m2 (mean +/- standard deviation), and we defined the range including +/- 2 standard deviations of the ratio as the normal ESSVR range. Six patients with AR and five patients with MR placed inside the normal ESSVR range, termed AR IN and MR IN, but the remaining five patients with AR and MR placed to the right of the normal range, termed AR OUT and MR OUT. EF did not differ between patients with AR IN and AR OUT (69.4 +/- 5.4 verus 70.7 +/- 6.1%) and between MR IN and MR OUT (71.6 +/- 3.6 versus 71.1 +/- 7.9%). The EF of the subdivided groups with AR and MR also did not differ from that of normal subjects (70.7 +/- 7.3%). This finding showed that the left ventricular contractile state was depressed in patients with AR OUT and MR OUT despite a normal EF. In AR and MR the end-systolic stress and end-systolic volume index of OUT did not differ from those of IN, but the end-diastolic volume index of OUT was larger than that of IN (AR OUT 156.8 +/- 27.9 versus AR IN 110.8 +/- 24.1 ml/m2, MR OUT 160.5 +/- 44.7 versus MR IN 101.0 +/ 16.6 ml/m2; both p less than 0.05), and the regurgitant fraction of OUT was higher than that of IN (AR OUT 52.6 +/- 13.6 versus AR IN 29.7 +/- 13.3%, MR OUT 52.9 +/- 10.2 versus MR IN 30.2 +/- 11.4%; both p less than 0.05). In addition, there was a linear inverse correlation between the end-systolic stress-volume index ratio and the end-diastolic volume index in all subjects (r = -0.82, n = 36). In normal subjects there was a linear inverse correlation between end-systolic stress and the EF (r = -0.91, n = 15), but this relationship failed to separate patients with OUT from those with IN. Results of the present study suggest that some patients with AR and MR whose EF was normal had a depressed contractile state, and these patients had a large end-diastolic volume index and a high regurgitant fraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
5	Isovolumic hemodilution with dextran 40 in the rat: effect on the development of peripheral edema and various physiologic parameters. Low molecular weight dextran 40 (D40), 40,000 daltons, is a potential therapeutic agent for cerebral ischemia because it increases local cerebral blood flow. However, the evaluation of D40 in the rat has been difficult due to systemic effects. We evaluated the effects of isovolumic hemodilution with D40 on the development of peripheral edema, mean arterial pressure, hematocrit (Hct) and total blood volume in 18 rats, during 30 min or 4 hr i.v. infusions, in animals with and without previous challenge with D40. Reduction of Hct without peripheral edema to a mean of approximately 31% was only achieved in the animals challenged with i.p. D40 24 hr before hemodilution and who received D40 over a period of 4 hr. Infusion of D40 over a period of 30 min was associated with shorter survival time, compared to the 4-hr infusion group (P less than .005). In the pretreated, rapidly infused group, total blood volume per body weight decreased significantly over time (P less than .005) and the mean arterial blood pressure dropped, but not significantly (P less than .07), whereas no change in Hct was detected and there was a trend toward increased peripheral edema, relative to the slowly infused groups. We conclude that reduction of Hct can be achieved successfully with i.p. administration of D40 24 hr before the study combined with infusion of the agent during a 4-hr period, without significant peripheral edema and early hypotension. This procedure should be used to avoid allergic reactions when evaluating hemodilution with D40 in rats. 
5	Fibrosing mediastinitis with coronary artery involvement. This case report describes a patient with chronic fibrosing mediastinitis involving the entire intrapericardial aorta, innominate artery, and the base of the heart with involvement of the proximal segments of the coronary arteries. This finding was unsuspected before emergency coronary artery bypass grafting. Coronary stenosis due to fibrosing mediastinitis is a rare complication of fibrosing mediastinitis. Owing to the extensive fibrosis, the normal bypass, cardiac preservation, and revascularization techniques required alteration and are discussed. 
5	The Dutch experience in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of narrowed saphenous veins used for aortocoronary arterial bypass. Of 19,994 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures performed in The Netherlands between April 1980 and January 1989, the long-term follow-up of 454 patients who underwent angioplasty of greater than or equal to 1 saphenous vein bypass graft was reviewed. In 46% of patients single graft angioplasty was attempted, and in 54% of patients sequential graft angioplasty was attempted. The clinical primary success rate was 90%. In-hospital mortality was 0.7%, 2.8% of patients sustained a procedural myocardial infarction, and 1.3% of patients underwent emergency bypass surgery. After a follow-up period of 5 years, 74% of patients were alive, and 26% were alive and event-free (no myocardial infarction, no repeat bypass surgery or repeat angioplasty). In patients in whom the initial angioplasty attempt was unsuccessful, only 3% were event-free at 5 years, versus 27% of successfully dilated patients. The time interval between the angioplasty attempt and previous surgery was a significant predictor for 5-year event-free survival. The event-free survival rates for patients who had bypass surgery 1 year before, between 1 and 5 years, and 5 years before angioplasty, were 45, 25 and 19%, respectively. Less than one-third of patients with previous bypass surgery who had angioplasty of the graft remained event-free after 5 years. In patients needing angioplasty within 1 year after bypass surgery, better long-term results were achieved. 
2	Effect of intraesophageal location and muscarinic blockade on balloon distension-induced chest pain. Intraesophageal balloon distension has been introduced recently as a provocative test in the assessment of patients with noncardiac chest pain. In order to examine the effect of balloon location and muscarinic blockade on distension-induced pain, 10 asymptomatic male volunteers were studied on two separate days using a low-compliance perfused manometry system that incorporated a silicone rubber balloon. Five-second-duration balloon distensions using balloon volumes of 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 ml of air were performed with the balloon located both 16 cm (proximal site) and 6 cm (distal site) above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) before and after administration of atropine (10 micrograms/kg intravenously) or placebo in a randomized double-blind fashion. A standardized scoring system was used to assess the balloon distension-induced pain. Pain scores varied directly with balloon volume but were consistently higher with the balloon located at the proximal site versus the distal site. This was not associated with any differences in intraballoon pressures between the two sites; however, contraction amplitude orad to the balloon was greater with balloon distension at the proximal site. Atropine significantly decreased pain sensation scores with the balloon located distally but not proximally. This attenuation was not associated with significant changes in intraballoon pressures; however, contractions orad to the balloon were markedly inhibited by atropine with distal but not with proximal distension. These studies indicate that balloon distension-induced pain varies depending on the location of distension. This difference is not explained by differences in esophageal wall tension at the site of distension. 
1	Inheritance of proliferative breast disease in breast cancer kindreds. Previous studies have emphasized that genetic susceptibility to breast cancer is rare and is expressed primarily as premenopausal breast cancer, bilateral breast cancer, or both. Proliferative breast disease (PBD) is a significant risk factor for the development of breast cancer and appears to be a precursor lesion. PBD and breast cancer were studied in 103 women from 20 kindreds that were selected for the presence of two first degree relatives with breast cancer and in 31 control women. Physical examination, screening mammography, and four-quadrant fine-needle breast aspirates were performed. Cytologic analysis of breast aspirates revealed PBD in 35% of clinically normal female first degree relatives of breast cancer cases and in 13% of controls. Genetic analysis suggests that genetic susceptibility causes both PBD and breast cancer in these kindreds. This study supports the hypothesis that this susceptibility is responsible for a considerable portion of breast cancer, including unilateral and postmenopausal breast cancer. 
5	The detubularized right colonic segment as urinary reservoir: evolution of technique for continent diversion. Continent diversion of urine via a cecal-right colonic reservoir has been performed at our university hospital since 1977. Several modifications of surgical technique have been devised to prevent problems of urinary leakage and difficulties in catheterization. The current technique, used during the last 3 years on 14 patients, involves use of a detubularized right colonic segment as a reservoir, ileal mesenteric exclusion, fashioning the intussuscepted ileal nipple valve with staples and anchoring of a fascia strip sling around the nipple base to the anterior rectus sheath. Complication from the reservoir outlet occurred in only 1 patient. 
5	The lovastatin-treated rodent: a new model of barrier disruption and epidermal hyperplasia. Recent studies have linked epidermal cholesterol synthesis with maintenance of the permeability barrier. To assess directly the importance of cholesterol synthesis, we applied lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, to hairless mouse skin. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) began to increase after four to six daily applications. Co-application of cholesterol blocked the expected increase in TEWL, demonstrating the importance of cholesterol for development of the lesion. The histology of lovastatin-treated skin revealed epidermal hyperplasia, accompanied by accelerated DNA synthesis. Whereas cholesterol synthesis initially was reduced in lovastatin-treated epidermis, with further treatment cholesterol synthesis normalized, while fatty acid synthesis accelerated greatly. Although the total free sterol content of lovastatin-treated epidermis remained normal, the fatty acid content increased coincident with barrier disruption. Finally, morphologic abnormalities of both lamellar body structure and their deposited, intercellular contents occurred coincident with the emerging biochemical abnormalities. Thus, the abnormal barrier function in this model can be ascribed to an initial inhibition of epidermal sterol synthesis followed by an alteration in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, leading to an imbalance in stratum corneum lipid composition and abnormal membrane bilayer structure. 
1	Stimulation of tumor cell growth by vasoactive intestinal peptide. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) stimulated the growth of murine Lewis lung carcinoma cells in culture. The growth promoting effect was dependent on the concentration of VIP. Exposure to VIP for 12 hours followed by removal of the peptide resulted in sustained growth promotion for 4 to 5 days in culture. Synthetic fragments of VIP, i.e., VIP (1-16) and VIP (22-28), and the unrelated peptide neurotensin failed to stimulate the growth of the Lewis lung carcinoma cells. The growth-promoting effect of VIP was also observed in a murine mammary tumor cell line and a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line. 
4	Significance of the number of stimuli to initiate ouabain-induced arrhythmias in the intact heart. Ouabain-induced arrhythmias are a well-known model used to study triggered activity resulting from delayed afterdepolarizations. In the intact heart, initiation of these arrhythmias is promoted by pacing, especially at fast rates. However, the relevance of the number of stimuli is unknown. In conscious dogs with formalin-induced atrioventricular block, we investigated the effect of variations in pacing mode on 1) the behavior of nonsustained triggered rhythms at progressive levels of ouabain intoxication, and 2) the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). Twenty experiments were analyzed. Ouabain was administered as a bolus of 40 micrograms/kg followed by continuous infusion. Every 15 minutes the pacing protocol was repeated, with a maximum of 10, until completion or induction of VT. When VT could not be initiated, the experiment was repeated at least 1 week later, adding 5-10 micrograms/kg ouabain to the bolus and increasing the infusion rate correspondingly. This was repeated until VT could be induced. Four interstimulus intervals (200, 400, 600, and 800 msec) and seven numbers of stimuli (5, 10, 20, 35, 50, 100, and 150) were given in two pacing protocols. The effect of these protocols on 1) the number of induced beats per stimulation train, 2) their first postpacing interval, and 3) induction of VT were studied. Initiation of VT occurred after 75 +/- 42 minutes. The bolus of ouabain needed to induce VT was inversely related to the body weight of the animals. Progression of ouabain intoxication resulted in 1) a significant increase in the number of induced beats per stimulation train and 2) a significant shortening of the first postpacing interval. Stimulation at a faster rate and/or more stimuli resulted in 1) a significantly pronounced increase in the number of induced beats at the higher levels and 2) a significantly shorter first postpacing interval at successive levels of ouabain intoxication. 
1	Antibodies to synthetic peptide (125-148) of the alpha-subunit of human nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in sera from patients with myasthenia gravis. We measured the amount of antibodies to a synthetic peptide that corresponds to the alpha-subunit residues Lys125-Thr148 of human acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in myasthenic sera. We detected anti-peptide antibodies in 52% (89/171) of the patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), but none in any of the healthy controls. Anti-peptide antibodies should provide a valuable immunologic parameter for the clinical evaluation of MG, but no apparent correlation was observed between the titers of anti-peptide and anti-AChR antibodies. 
3	Trichothiodystrophy with chronic neutropenia and mild mental retardation. Trichothiodystrophy is a feature of several diseases that consist of characteristic hair shaft abnormalities and a wide spectrum of other developmental defects. Detection of sulfur-deficient hairs identifies this disorder and separates it from other similar ectodermal dysplasias with normal sulfur content. Detection of low sulfur hair syndrome is also important for genetic counseling, because the disease appears to be an autosomal recessive trait. We report a patient with chronic neutropenia, mild mental retardation, and low sulfur content in hair. Our case expands the spectrum of disorders associated with trichothiodystrophy. 
4	Transcranial Doppler determination of cerebral perfusion in patients undergoing CPR: methodology and preliminary findings. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To correlate cerebral arterial blood velocity measurements as determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasound with various resuscitation maneuvers performed in an uncontrolled manner in a series of cardiac arrest patients undergoing standard resuscitation. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Any patient undergoing resuscitation for a nontraumatic cardiac arrest was eligible for the study. INTERVENTIONS: Resuscitation was carried out while flow velocities were monitored in various intracranial arteries by transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Vessel identification was based on the angle and depth of insonation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The internal carotid artery was located more consistently than either middle cerebral or ophthalmic arteries and provided superior waveforms for analysis. Alterations in flow velocity were noted and correlated to various therapeutic interventions. Flow velocities were 70% of normal during the early phase of resuscitation but deteriorated over time until there was no evidence of net forward flow. Even early in CPR, flow was demonstrated only during systole. CONCLUSION: Transcranial Doppler ultrasound appears to be a potentially promising means of determining cerebral flow in patients undergoing CPR. 
2	Successful treatment of pancreatic pseudocyst with a somatostatin analogue and catheter drainage. We report a patient with bile duct stone-induced pancreatitis who subsequently developed a large pseudocyst that became infected after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was done for extraction of the stones. Percutaneous external drainage allowed control of the infection, but failed to seal the pseudocyst. We then treated the patient with a long-acting somatostatin analogue which shrunk the cyst within a week. Patients with pancreatic pseudocyst resistant to drainage should be offered a course of somatostatin before surgery is contemplated. 
1	The relationship of "high risk" mammographic patterns to histological risk factors for development of cancer in the human breast. In the UK Trial for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer in Nottingham, 119 women were identified as having fibrocystic change with epithelial hyperplasia or in situ carcinoma. Their mammograms were classified according to Wolfe's criteria and the corresponding histology for each patient was classified for degrees of epithelial hyperplasia, atypia and in situ neoplasia using Page's criteria. A control population of patients presenting for breast screening was used to represent the general population. No correlation was found between the four mammographic Wolfe patterns, N1, P1, P2 and DY and histological evidence of epithelial hyperplasia, atypia or in situ carcinoma. A further study was carried out to determine histological features of Wolfe pattern, using radiological examination of resected breast tissue. The variation in Wolfe pattern was related to the distribution of fibrous and adipose tissue in the breast interlobular stroma and appeared to have no relationship to epithelial parenchymal content. This information does not support the hypothesis that radiographic densities of P2 and DY patterns correspond to high risk epithelial proliferation. 
5	Urinary tract infection in women. Current role of single-dose therapy. Administration of a single dose of an antimicrobial agent is acceptable therapy for women with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections. There is adequate information in the literature to support the clinical use of single-dose therapy, although there is still a need for further, well-designed, sufficiently large studies that compare single-dose therapy to abbreviated-course (3-day) and traditional (7- to 14-day) therapy. 
5	Results of vein graft reconstruction of the lower extremity in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. The results of 171 vein grafts of the lower extremity were evaluated. These were placed between January 1981 and December 1987 in 150 patients, 75 diabetic and 75 nondiabetic, to determine the influence of diabetes on the outcome of the procedure. One and four year patency rates were determined by a life table analysis. No statistical differences in primary patency were found between the patients with diabetes and those without diabetes for all indications of operations (one year, diabetic patients 95 +/- 3 per cent, nondiabetic patients 85 +/- 3 per cent; four years, diabetic patients 89 +/- 11 per cent and nondiabetic patients 80 +/- 12 per cent; p = n.s.). For those operated upon for salvage of the limb because of rest pain, ulceration or gangrene, patency in diabetic patients at one year approached a statistically significant advantage (diabetic patients 94 +/- 4 per cent versus nondiabetic patients 79 +/- 8 per cent; p = 0.056). We believe that arterial reconstruction of the lower extremity can be performed upon patients with diabetes with the same high degree of success for revascularization and salvage of the limb as can be accomplished in nondiabetic patients. This is true even though those with diabetes present with necrosis of the tissue and more often require bypass to distal tibial arteries. 
3	Effect of normal MSAFP screening on maternal age for genetic amniocentesis. Routine maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening for neural tube defects is considered by many to be standard obstetrical care, and recently many have encouraged this test to screen for Trisomy-21 (Down's syndrome). We questioned whether, after a normal MSAFP screen, the risk of Trisomy-21 decreases enough to warrant modifying the recommended age for genetic amniocentesis for Down's syndrome. A logistic regression was developed which, using reported values for sensitivity and specificity for MSAFP detection of Trisomy-21 and assuming a constant threshold risk in opting for amniocentesis, indicates that genetic amniocentesis for Trisomy-21 may be deferred in some women who have a normal MSAFP screening. Sensitivity analysis of varying thresholds for a normal MSAFP demonstrates that a 37 year old woman with a median MSAFP level has the same risk for Trisomy-21 as an unscreened women who is 4.5 years younger. An abnormal MSAFP is useful in screening for neural tube defects and possibly for Trisomy-21. A normal MSAFP may allow for delaying the potentially risky amniocentesis in otherwise low-risk pregnancies. 
5	Use of a knee-brace for control of tibial translation and rotation. A comparison, in cadavera, of available models. We assessed the relative restraints that are provided by fourteen currently available functional knee-braces, using six limbs in cadavera. The tests were made at 30 and 60 degrees of flexion of the knee, and a mechanical loading system applied loads that caused anterior-posterior translation and internal-external rotation. The braces limited abnormal tibiofemoral displacements by 10 to 75 per cent in translation; there was more variation in rotation. This study demonstrated that functional knee-braces provide a restraining influence that may be beneficial in the control of abnormal displacements of the knee, but that the degree of restraint varies considerably. 
4	Comparison of early versus late experience with percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty. The immediate outcome of the first 150 patients (Group 1) and the last 161 patients (Group 2) who underwent percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty was compared. There was no difference between the two groups in age, gender, New York Heart Association functional class, presence of calcification, atrial fibrillation, degree of mitral regurgitation, mean pulmonary artery pressure, left atrial pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary vascular resistance, mitral valve gradient and mitral valve area. Fewer patients in Group 1 than Group 2 had an echocardiographic score less than or equal to 8 (62% versus 69%, respectively, p = 0.02). The atrial septum was dilated with an 8 mm balloon in 74% of patients in Group 1 and with a 5 mm balloon in all patients in Group 2. Ratio of effective balloon dilating area to body surface area was larger in Group 1 than in Group 2 (4.05 +/- 0.07 versus 3.7 +/- 0.03 cm2/m2, p = 0.0001). A good result (mitral valve area greater than or equal to 1.5 cm2) was obtained in 77% and 75% in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = NS). After percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty, a greater than or equal to 2 grade increase in mitral regurgitation was noted in 12% of Group 1 and 6% of Group 2 (p = 0.02) and a left to right shunt was detected in 22% of Group 1 and 11% of Group 2 (p = 0.0001). There were three procedure-related deaths in Group 1, but none in Group 2. 
3	Prospective observations of 100 high-risk neonates by high-field (1.5 Tesla) magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system: I. Intraventricular and extracerebral lesions. The results of observations of the first 100 neonates at the University of Texas Health Science Center (Houston) who received magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system by means of a high-field image (1.5 T) are reported. All were assessed prospectively to be at risk neurodevelopmental delay. This first report specifically addresses the appearance of primarily hemorrhagic intracranial lesions, including intraventricular hemorrhage (n = 28), and extracerebral lesions, which include 3 cases of venous sinus thrombosis (n = 20). The signal intensities of hemorrhage underwent a characteristic evolution with time with only minor variations in the study group. Magnetic resonance imaging detected direct evidence of hemorrhage for up to 2 months, but hemosiderin was detected as a late indicator of hemorrhage for up to 9 months. Magnetic resonance imaging was equal in benefit to head ultrasonography and computed tomography for the diagnosis of intraventricular hemorrhage, but magnetic resonance imaging was also able to approximate the time of onset of hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging was superior for the evaluation of extracerebral hemorrhage; ultrasonography failed to detect any of these lesions and computed tomography detected only 3 of 7. Short-term neurological abnormality was assessed, but the ability of magnetic resonance imaging to predict long-term neurodevelopmental delay is unknown and is the subject of an ongoing project. 
4	Prevention of paraplegia during aortic operations. Ischemic spinal cord injury after aortic cross-clamping may be produced by a steal phenomenon. The present study investigates this possibility by directly measuring the oxygen tension on the spinal cord surface in pigs. After simple clamping of the aorta, oxygen tension decreased significantly distal to the clamping site both after occlusion of the thoracic aorta at T3-4 (group 1) and after occlusion of the abdominal aorta at L-1 (group 2). Exclusion of the thoracic aorta by a second clamp at T-13 restored oxygen tension almost to the original level, whereas segmentation of the abdominal aorta up to S-1 hardly affected oxygen tension in the area of the artery of Adamkiewicz in most of the animals. We conclude that after aortic cross-clamping, blood tends to drain away from the spinal cord rather than supplying it longitudinally. Without knowledge of the position of the Adamkiewicz artery in humans as well as of the competence of the collateral circulation in the excluded segment, it is necessary to develop a new strategy for repair of the aorta. We describe and discuss two surgical techniques for the prevention of paraplegia after aortic cross-clamping: the counterocclusion technique and the bypass fractionated technique. 
5	Expert testimony based on decision analysis: a malpractice case report. OBJECTIVE: Expert testimony in malpractice cases is often subjective and biased. Decision-analytic techniques might provide an objective basis for such testimony. DESIGN: Case report. This article reports the case of a patient with chest pain that resulted in a malpractice suit alleging a delay in diagnosis of coronary artery disease. SETTING: The case occurred in a private practice; the expert witnesses and the decision analysis originated from a university teaching hospital. METHODS: A decision tree and threshold analysis were used to define the thresholds of disease probability at which either testing or treatment should be implemented. The expert testimony of two witnesses that exercise stress testing was the standard of care was compared with the results of the decision analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Decision analysis supported the view that cardiac catheterization would have been the more appropriate test. CONCLUSIONS: Techniques of decision analysis provide a structured and quantitative basis for empirical judgment and may help to minimize current problems with expert testimony. 
4	Renal effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in congestive heart failure. Some studies report that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) improves renal function in patients with congestive heart failure, whereas others report that renal deterioration is a frequent complication of treatment with ACE inhibitors. This article explores the mechanisms by which antagonism of the renin-angiotensin system improves kidney function in some patients while causing harm in others. ACE inhibition may alter renal blood flow, glomerular perfusion pressure, basement membrane activity and renal tubular function both directly and indirectly. In most patients, renal function is maintained as other neurohormonal mechanisms compensate for the negative effects and permit the positive effects (such as improved renal flow) to predominate. However, when physiologic characteristics or iatrogenic interventions (such as volume reduction or prostaglandin inhibition) limit the effectiveness of neurohormonal compensation to maintain renal autoregulation, clinically important deterioration in renal function may occur. An understanding of the renal effects of ACE inhibitors permits their safe and effective use in most patients with congestive heart failure. 
4	A 5.3-kb deletion including exon XIII of the protein S alpha gene occurs in two protein S-deficient families. Genomic DNA samples from 12 protein S-deficient families with hereditary thrombophilia were analyzed by Southern hybridization using protein S cDNA probes. Protein S-deficient members of families A and B possessed identical restriction fragment length polymorphisms, which suggest the absence of 5.3 kb from one of their protein S alpha alleles. The abnormal alleles from individuals A7 and B1 were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using a forward primer in intron K and a reverse primer in exon XIV. The amplified DNA was cloned and sequenced. Sequence comparison with the normal protein S alpha gene showed that most of intron L (roughly 4.7 kb), the entire exon XIII (151 bp), and about a quarter of intron M (407 bp) were missing from both the A7 and B1 clones. Exon XIII contains all three potential N-glycosylation sites in human protein S. This deletion may result in RNA transcripts in which exon XII is spliced to exon XIV. Such an arrangement would generate a stop codon at position 463 and consequently produce a nonglycosylated protein S molecule truncated by 173 amino acids. 
2	Laparoscopic cholecystectomy using intracorporeal lithotripsy. Over a 13-month period (November 1988 to December 1989), we performed our first 104 laparoscopic cholecystectomies using an intracorporeal ultrasonic lithotripsy technique. The procedure in three of these patients was converted to an open operation because of hemorrhage with unexpected findings of cirrhosis in two patients and dense subhepatic adhesions in a third. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was successfully used in three other patients in whom common bile duct stones were identified. We encountered only three postoperative complications out of all the laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed. One complication was a biliary fistula that closed spontaneously 1 week after surgery. The remaining complications were attributable to abscesses, one subhepatic and one pelvic, which were aspirated and drained laparoscopically. There were no deaths. Advantages of the laparoscopic approach included decreased perioperative pain, shortened hospitalization, absence of scar, and more rapid return to prehospitalization activities. 
3	Normal proprioceptive trigeminal afferents in patients with Sjogren's syndrome and sensory neuronopathy. A pure sensory neuropathy due to neuronal damage in the gasserian and spinal ganglia has been described in patients with Sjogren's syndrome. Conventional electromyographic (EMG) studies can demonstrate the selective involvement of the sensory pathways but they do not provide definite evidence for the site of the lesion. Noting that the trigeminal sensory neurons carrying cutaneous and muscular afferents are differentially located in the gasserian and mesencephalic nuclei, respectively, we carried out an electrophysiological study of the trigeminofacial and trigeminotrigeminal reflexes in 5 patients with Sjogren's syndrome and pure sensory neuropathy, in 10 patients with sensory-motor neuropathies of other causes, and in 10 healthy subjects. Our results show that patients with Sjogren's syndrome and pure sensory neuropathy who exhibited abnormal blink reflexes and an abnormal, cutaneous-induced masseter silent period had normal jaw jerks, whereas patients with sensory-motor neuropathies who exhibited abnormal cutaneous responses had abnormal jaw jerks. These findings suggest that the lesion in pure sensory neuropathy involves damage to the neurons of the gasserian ganglia and not to the trigeminal axons, since an axonal lesion would be expected to involve the large axons from muscle spindle receptors. 
5	Combined modality therapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma. Multi-modality treatment consisting of cisplatin, VP-16, and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy given concomitantly with external beam radiation was used to treat 64 patients with locally advanced Stage III non-small cell lung carcinoma. This regimen was used in a preoperative fashion for four cycles in patients considered surgically resectable and with curative intent for six cycles in the remainder of patients. The clinical response rate for the entire group was 84% and the overall local control rate was 74%. The median survival was 13 months with a median follow-up for live patients of 19 months. The actuarial 3-year survival and disease-free survival rates were 30% and 23%, respectively. Histologic complete response was 39% and appeared to predict for survival. The 3-year actuarial survival and disease-free survival rates for 23 resected patients were 69% and 45%, respectively, with the complete histologic responders having a disease-free survival of 78%. The pattern of first recurrence did not appear to differ by histology or presence of lymph nodes in this subset of patients. The actuarial 3-year survival and disease-free survival rates for inoperable patients receiving six cycles of treatment were 18% and 23%, respectively. The local control was 67% with the majority of these patients having Stage IIIB disease. The Mountain International staging system appeared to predict for operability, local recurrence, and survival. This concomitant treatment regimen is feasible, with the major toxicities being leukopenia, nausea, and vomiting. 
1	High-risk factors in metastatic gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. The patient with gestational trophoblastic neoplasia faces a number of risks; the greatest is the failure of current treatment to bring about remission. Based on a review of past experience, a number of risk factors associated with failure of single-agent chemotherapy were identified, and the subsequent utilization of combination chemotherapy led to an improved outcome. An analysis of more recent experience has identified factors associated with the failure of standard combination chemotherapy, and it is hoped that the development of new treatments will again improve the outcome. This review provides a perspective on known high-risk factors in light of contemporary treatment. 
1	A prospective study of double diagnosis of nonpalpable lesions of the breast. Approximately three-fourths of open biopsies of the breast performed for mammographically detected suspicious lesions are shown histologically to be benign. Under the narrow conditions described herein, stereotaxic fine-needle aspiration (FNA) can identify these lesions with an accuracy of more than 90 per cent and a false-negative rate of 5 per cent. In an effort to reduce this failure rate, the mammographic appearance and stereotaxic FNA results of these lesions each were given scores on a scale of zero (benign) to five (malignant), to derive an over-all risk score prospectively applied to 264 suspicious occult lesions of the breast prior to open, biopsy. While all 264 lesions could be assigned a mammographic score, adequate tissue for assignment of a cytologic score could be obtained from 150 lesions. Of the 150 evaluable lesions, 53 were malignant and 97 were benign, historically. With a total score of two as the threshold for open biopsy, 21 of 150 (14 per cent) were proved to be benign, with no false-negative findings. If the total threshold score mandating an open biopsy was raised to four, the comparable figures were 61 of 150 (40 per cent) benign lesions and two false-negative instances of carcinoma in situ. Provided adequate tissue is aspirated for cytologic examination, we conclude that this algorithm has practical value in the management of nonpalpable lesions of the breast in that it can reliably identify a fraction of the benign lesions and spare these patients an operation. 
4	Acute myocardial infarction and chest pain syndromes after cocaine use. Seventy patients hospitalized with chest pain after cocaine use were retrospectively evaluated to define the risk and clinical course of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMI developed in 22 patients (31%) and transient myocardial ischemia was seen in an additional 9 patients (13%). Coronary risk factors did not distinguish those who developed AMI from those who did not. The presenting electrocardiogram was abnormal in 20 of 22 patients who evolved AMI and in 19 of 48 of those who did not. Creatine kinase levels were elevated in 75% of the patients, including 65% of those who did not develop AMI, but creatine kinase-MB elevations were only observed in the AMI group. The route of cocaine administration did not predict AMI and there was no predilection for a particular coronary vascular bed. The length of time between drug use and onset of AMI pain was often quite prolonged (median interval, 18 vs 1 hour in the non-AMI group). Eight of the patients with AMI underwent cardiac catheterization and 4 had significant coronary narrowing. 
2	Persistent hepatitis B virus following interferon alfa therapy and liver transplantation. A 44-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and cirrhosis was treated with recombinant human interferon alfa for 67 days immediately before orthotopic liver transplantation and immunoprophylaxis with hyperimmune globulin to hepatitis B virus in the peritransplant period. Dot blots for hepatitis B virus DNA demonstrated marked reduction in viremia after 41 days of interferon alfa treatment. Southern analysis for hepatitis B virus in liver showed a pronounced decrement in actively replicating forms in the explant, although hepatic infection was still detectable. After liver transplantation, tests for serum hepatitis B virus DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen remained negative. The patient died 32 days after transplantation of causes unrelated to hepatitis B virus. DNA isolated from liver and other visceral organs at autopsy showed infection of the engrafted liver and the persistence of monomeric relaxed circular forms of hepatitis B virus DNA in pancreas, kidney, and spleen. Thus, graft reinfection occurred despite aggressive antiviral therapy and immunoprophylaxis combined with liver transplantation. Existing viral serological markers appear insufficiently sensitive to assess residual infectivity. 
5	Reduced atrial contribution to left ventricular filling in patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation after tricuspid valvulectomy: a Doppler echocardiographic study. Patients undergoing valvulectomy for isolated tricuspid valve endocarditis offer the unique opportunity to study the effects of acquired right ventricular volume overload on left ventricular filling in persons free of pulmonary hypertension and preexisting left heart disease. Eleven patients who had undergone total or partial removal of the tricuspid valve were compared with 11 age-matched control subjects; Doppler echocardiographic techniques were used to quantify changes in left ventricular filling and to relate them to changes in left ventricular and left atrial geometry caused by right ventricular and right atrial distension. The late diastolic fractional transmitral flow velocity integral, a measure of the left atrial contribution to left ventricular filling, was significantly decreased in patients undergoing tricuspid valvulectomy compared with control subjects (0.22 +/- 0.11 versus 0.32 +/- 0.09; p less than 0.04). Severe tricuspid regurgitation in these patients resulted in marked right atrial distension, reversal of the normal interatrial septal curvature and compression of the left atrium such that left atrial area was significantly smaller than in control subjects (5.9 +/- 2.2 versus 8.6 +/- 1.2 cm2/m2; p less than 0.005). Acting as a receiving chamber, the left ventricle was maximally compressed by the volume-overloaded right ventricle in late diastole, coincident with the timing of atrial systole, resulting in a significant increase in the left ventricular eccentricity index compared with that in control subjects (1.35 +/- 0.14 versus 1.03 +/- 0.1; p less than 0.001). Thus, right ventricular volume overload due to severe tricuspid regurgitation results in left heart geometric alterations that decrease left atrial preload, impair left ventricular receiving chamber characteristics and reduce the atrial contribution to total left ventricular filling. 
5	Cardiac arrhythmias from a malpositioned Greenfield filter in a traumatic quadriplegic. A case study is presented of premature Greenfield filter discharge with intracardiac migration and resulting life-threatening arrhythmias. These arrhythmias also interfered with the patient's transition from ventilatory support via orotracheal intubation to noninvasive positive airway pressure ventilatory support methods. The patient's arrhythmias were controlled by a demand cardiac pacemaker and cardiac glycoside therapy. No anticoagulants were used. She had no further filter migration nor significant complications for 16 months after hospital discharge. 
1	Flow cytometry for clinical estimation of circulating hematopoietic progenitors for autologous transplantation in cancer patients. Optimum methods of harvesting circulating hematopoietic progenitors for autologous transplantation to support myeloablative cancer therapy are still uncertain, mostly because of the lack of an assay for marrow-repopulating stem cells. The CFU-GM assay, the commonly used indirect indicator of the quality of the graft, is poorly standardized and provides results evaluable only retrospectively. Based on the knowledge that hematopoietic progenitors express CD34 and CD33 differentiation antigens, we developed a dual-color direct immunofluorescence flow cytometry assay with the aim of replacing the CFU-GM assay advantageously. For this purpose, we applied both assays to 157 blood samples obtained daily throughout 20 different recoveries from pancytopenia induced by high-dose cyclophosphamide or etoposide cancer therapy with or without recombinant human GM colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF). The appearance of CD34+ cells in the circulation indicated that hematopoietic progenitors had increased to more than 500 CFU-GM/mL, a level clinically adequate for large-scale harvest by leukapheresis. Total CD34+ cells correlated well with CFU-GM (r = .89), and data could be fitted by a linear regression line described by the equation y = 388.3 + 64.0x, where y = CFU-GM/mL and x = CD34+ cells per microliter. Moreover, in a series of six patients treated with myeloablative chemoradiotherapy, early hematopoietic recovery of marrow functions was predicted more accurately by the number of transplanted CD34+/CD33+ cells than by either total nucleated cells, CFU-GM, CD34+/CD33- cells, or CD34-/CD33+ cells. Data presented in this article favor clinical use of the CD34/CD33 flow cytometry assay to guide harvesting of circulating hematopoietic progenitors for autologous transplantation and contribute to better understanding of the role played by circulating hematopoietic progenitor cell subsets in marrow recovery after myeloablative cancer therapy. 
5	Profound digital collagen atrophy: a new cutaneous presentation of adrenal-dependent Cushing's syndrome. A 59-year-old Caucasian housewife presented with a 2-year history of marked loss of tissue substance from the finger and toe pulps and the heel pads. There was no clinical evidence or history of urticaria or other inflammatory change. Investigations demonstrated a raised plasma cortisol secondary to a left adrenal adenoma. Skin biopsies showed abnormalities of dermal collagen, but no evidence of elastin destruction. This case presents an unusual variant of the cutaneous atrophy associated with Cushing's syndrome. 
3	Naproxen sodium in menstrual migraine prophylaxis: a double-blind placebo controlled study. In this study, the efficacy of Naproxen sodium (Nxs) in the prophylaxis of Menstrual Migraine (MM) was tested, versus Placebo (PL). Forty women suffering from MM were admitted to a double-blind treatment protocol with Nxs 550 mg twice each day by mouth or Placebo (PL), for 3 months; in the next 3 months all the women were treated with the active drug in an open study. The headache intensity and duration, as well as the number of days of headache and the analgesic consumption, were significantly reduced with Nxs compared to PL. The efficacy of Nxs, shown also in improving premenstrual pain, and its good tolerability, support the use of this drug in the prophylactic therapy of MM. 
3	Ulnar nerve decompression with medial epicondylectomy for neuropathy at the elbow. Ulnar nerve decompression with medial epicondylectomy was performed in 66 elbows between 1966 and 1986 for compressive ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. This study is an updated review that adds 36 cases to a previously published report on 30 cases. These elbows were graded preoperatively and postoperatively using McGowan's grading system. Eighty-three percent improved one or two grades, and 11% improved subjectively although they showed no objective improvement, 3% noted no change, and 3% were subjectively worse. One early case sustained damage to the ulnar collateral ligament with resultant instability. No other complications occurred. The best results were seen in the Grade I and II lesions, whereas those with Grade III lesions were the least predictable. The procedure is technically uncomplicated with minimal morbidity and reliable results. 
3	Circulatory and thermal adjustments to prolonged exercise in paraplegic women. The circulatory and thermal responses to 90 min of wheelchair ergometer exercise were examined in five wheelchair dependent (WD) women with low level spinal dysfunction and five able-bodied (AB) women who served as a comparison group. Metabolic rate during exercise was 221 W for WD and 255 W for AB (P greater than 0.05). Oral temperature (Tor), mean skin temperature (Tsk), oxygen uptake (VO2), heart rate (HR), and cardiac output (Qc) were assessed periodically throughout the exercise period. Ambient conditions were 24-25 degrees C and 38-52% relative humidity. A significant group X time interaction was found for Tor (P less than 0.001) and Tsk (P less than 0.001). Tor of the WD group steadily increased during the exercise, whereas the AB group showed a stable Tor. Tsk of WD increased rapidly during the first 5-10 min of exercise and continued to rise at a slower rate throughout the exercise. In contrast, Tsk of AB rose to a peak during the first 10 min and then showed a decreasing trend. VO2 and HR remained stable in both groups throughout the exercise period. Following an initial increase in Qc from minute 10 to minute 20 in both groups, values for WD continually decreased until Qc at 80 min was 14% lower than at 10 min. The findings suggest that the WD women had greater thermoregulatory strain than the AB women as indicated by a higher Tor and Tsk and by an inability to maintain Qc due to paralysis of the lower limbs and perhaps an increase in cutaneous blood volume. 
1	Complications associated with limb salvage for extremity sarcomas and their management. A retrospective clinical review of 100 consecutive patients with extremity sarcomas managed by limb salvage operations was performed to evaluate local tumor control and morbidity. The mean follow-up period was 45.1 months. Overall survival was 86%. There were local recurrences in 3% of patients, and 26 complications in 22 patients. Wound necrosis was the most frequent complication. Failure of allogeneic bone graft operations occurred in 25 patients. Most of the complications were salvageable without loss of limb. Limb salvage is an acceptable surgical treatment of extremity sarcomas based on adequate local control and minimal morbidity. 
4	Application of time series analysis to circadian rhythms: effect of beta-adrenergic blockade upon heart rate and transient myocardial ischemia. Circadian variations of transient myocardial ischemia and heart rate have been identified, but the rhythms and their response to beta blockade have not been fully characterized. Time-series analysis, a mathematical technique to describe oscillatory activity occurring within a continuous data set was used, to address these issues. Nine men with coronary artery disease underwent 72 hours of ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring during therapy with placebo or metoprolol. During administration of placebo, ischemic time and heart rate showed a primary peak with a periodicity of approximately 24 hours with a tight coupling between the 2 variables and a secondary peak with a periodicity of 5 to 8 hours. During metoprolol therapy, heart rate and ischemic variation were reduced and the 24-hour periodicity for heart rate only remained. The 24-hour periodicity for ischemia was eliminated, but the data with 5- to 8-hour periodicity became the major component of the signal. 
5	Repair of cartilage lesions using biological implants. A comparative histological and biomechanical study in goats. We report the experimental use of three different biological implants to restore articular surface defects: glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine meniscal xenograft, glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine costal cartilage xenograft, and viable osteochondral allografts. The grafts were implanted in the knees of 19 goats who were allowed free-field activity and were studied for up to one year. The natural articular surfaces of meniscal fibrocartilage provided excellent articular surfaces at all times. Equally good articular surfaces were restored by host tissue growth covering costal cartilage grafts at six months, but by 12 months this surface had degenerated. The majority of the allografts survived and integrated with the host at six months, but many showed signs of failure at 12 months. Only three out of seven ungrafted defects healed completely at six months and the healed surfaces were degenerating at 12 months. 
4	Sequential gradient pneumatic compression enhances venous ulcer healing: a randomized trial. The treatment of venous ulcers has remained largely unchanged for centuries. The application of properly applied graduated compression bandages, the use of graduated compression stockings, and surgery have been shown to achieve healing. However, some ulcers persist despite appropriate management. A randomized study was undertaken to compare two regimens of treatment for such patients. Both regimens included ulcer debridement, cleaning, nonadherent dressing, and graduated compression stockings. In one regimen, sequential gradient intermittent pneumatic compression was applied for 4 hours each day. Only one of 24 patients in the control group had complete healing of all ulcers compared with 10 of 21 patients healed in the intermittent pneumatic compression group. The median rate of ulcer healing in the control group was 2.1% area per week compared to 19.8% area per week in the intermittent pneumatic compression group. The results indicate that sequential gradient intermittent pneumatic compression is beneficial in the treatment of venous ulcers. 
5	Autoradiographic evaluation of monoclonal antibodies' access to melanoma-associated antigens in melanoma xenografts. Autoradiography of nude mice bearing human malignant melanoma xenografts was performed to characterize the distribution pattern of radioiodinated anti-melanoma monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) and fragments in macroscopic tumor nodules. Non-uniformity of radioactivity distribution was seen in all MoAb-xenograft combinations. The predominant patterns were marked deposition of radioactivity either in the periphery of nodules or in sharply delimited intra-tumoral foci. These patterns were generated by limitations in the accessibility of melanoma tissue rather than gross necrosis or heterogeneity of antigen expression. Computer-aided densitometry of autoradiograms was used to elaborate the difference of accumulation in intra-tumoral hot spots versus cold areas. It was found that increasing uniformity was achieved by increasing the dose of MoAb (i.e., intact IgG) injected, whereas a reduction in the size of MoAb (IgG greater than F(ab')2 greater than Fab) showed no such effect. 
4	Management of renovascular disease. A surgical perspective. The role of surgical revascularization in the management of patients with renal artery disease has changed in recent years. This has occurred due to the advent of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty as an effective method of treatment for certain patients, improved results of surgical revascularization in older patients with atherosclerosis, an enhanced appreciation of advanced atherosclerotic renal artery disease as a correctable cause of renal failure, and the development of more effective surgical techniques for patients with severe aortic atherosclerosis and branch renal artery disease. Surgical revascularization is currently the treatment of choice for patients with branch renal artery disease, ostial atherosclerotic renal artery disease, a renal artery aneurysm, and patients in whom renal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty has been unsuccessful. Excellent clinical results continue to be achieved with surgical revascularization in properly selected patients. 
3	Measurement of progressive cerebral ventriculomegaly in infants after grades III and IV intraventricular hemorrhages. To develop guidelines that might help predict prospectively which infants with severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) would require intervention, we obtained serial cranial sonograms to measure the rate of growth of cerebral ventricular volumes in 48 preterm infants with and without IVH. The infants were divided into three groups: (1) those with no IVH (22 infants), (2) those with IVH with acute ventricular dilation (13 infants), and (3) those with IVH with progressive ventricular dilation requiring intervention (13 infants). The decision to intervene because of progressive ventricular dilation was based on clinical criteria and the subjective assessment of increasing ventricular size on weekly cranial sonograms. The rate of cerebral ventricular volume growth in infants with IVH who needed intervention was greater (4.2 +/- 3.3 ml/day) than that in infants without IVH (0.0 +/- 0.1 ml/day; p less than 0.001) and in infants with IVH and acute ventricular dilation (0.0 +/- 0.2 ml/day; p less than 0.001). Using these data, we generated guidelines for predicting prospectively which infants with IVH and ventricular dilation will need intervention for posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. The guidelines were then confirmed prospectively in 10 infants. 
5	Nutrient modulation of inflammatory and immune function. The metabolic response to injury occurs after a diverse group of surgical injuries including major surgical intervention, shock, infection, and sources of inflammation such as pancreatitis. The response is mediated by the macroendocrine system, the autonomic nervous system, and the cell-cell communication system. The clinical manifestations include now well-described clinical, physiologic, and metabolic characteristics. The approach of aggressive source control, invasive circulatory resuscitation, and nutrition/metabolic support has been associated with an overall reduction in morbidity and mortality. In those patients who do not respond to this approach, the disease process progresses to multiple organ failure syndrome with its associated high mortality. Altering the route of feeding, preventing single nutrient and generalized nutrient deficiency, and reducing nosocomial infections with selective gut decontamination have not significantly altered the course or outcome of the disease process in this latter group of patients with persistent hypermetabolism. The available data support the position that this persistent hypermetabolism represents abnormal metabolic regulation resulting in persistence of the inflammatory response with associated suppression of the immune defenses. A number of research approaches are being taken to understand and modulate this abnormal state of regulation. Because of the role of specific nutrients in these regulatory processes, beyond their role in classic nutrition support, nutrients such as arginine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and RNA are being evaluated for their ability to modulate inflammation and to improve immune function. Preliminary results are encouraging. 
1	Corporate-sponsored breast cancer screening at the work site: results of a statewide program. Mobile screening mammography was offered to 3,627 employees of a large corporation in Pennsylvania and Delaware. The examination was available to women employees or employee spouses aged 35 years and older. Women were charged $30 for a standard two-view examination. They also received health education materials on mammography and breast self-examination. The remaining costs of the program were underwritten by the corporation. During this program, 3,627 mammographic studies were performed; 63 biopsies were recommended. Fifty-seven biopsies were performed, and nine cancers were diagnosed. Costs of this program are presented in detail. The authors conclude that mobile screening programs at the work site provide an inexpensive, convenient alternative to more traditional screening programs. The inherent advantages of this program are the low cost, the relative ease with which the examination can be performed, and the positive role that corporate medical personnel assume in encouraging individual and group participation. 
2	Biliary lithotripsy: in vitro analysis of gallstone fragmentation for equivalent stone volumes. The relationship between gallstone fragmentation during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and gallstone volume is poorly understood. Clinical results of ESWL show that the highest stone-free rate at 6 months occurs with radiolucent single gallstones 20 mm or less in diameter. In an in vitro study, individual gallstones from cholecystectomy specimens were divided by size and composition into nine single- and nine multiple-stone groups; the stones were then paired on the basis of similar volume. ESWL was performed in a phantom and the size of the largest fragment was measured at 500, 1,000, and 1,500 shock waves. At 1,500 shock waves, sandlike particles were present in six of nine single stones versus two of nine multiple stone groups; the mean size of the largest fragment at 1,500 shock waves was 2.1 mm (single) and 4.4 mm (multiple) in diameter. When corrected for volume, the authors' data suggest that single stones are more easily broken into fragments smaller than 5 mm in diameter than multiple gallstones. The implication, especially when spark-gap technology is used, is that more shock wave energy (ie, an increased number of shock waves at a higher kilovoltage) will be necessary to achieve the same results when treating patients with multiple stones versus a single gallstone with a similar stone volume. 
1	Male breast cancer. Male breast cancer is uncommon but important. The diagnosis is easily made by breast biopsy, and patients are presenting earlier in the course of the disease than in the past. Despite this, patients are often first seen with tumors that have metastasized to the axillary nodes, which markedly decreases the survival rate. Therapy of localized disease includes simple excision, modified radical mastectomy, and radical mastectomy, but there is no consensus for which operation is appropriate. Radiation therapy should be strongly considered in patients with metastases to the axillary nodes, but the role of adjuvant hormonal therapy or chemotherapy is unclear. For treatment of disseminated disease, tamoxifen seems to be replacing orchiectomy. The favorable response rate, especially in patients with estrogen-receptor-positive tumors, the lack of side effects, and the high level of patient acceptability make it an attractive therapeutic choice. 
4	New developments in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Since the last revision of the American Heart Association's guidelines in 1985, several new developments of clinical importance have occurred in the field of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. These include enhanced access to and earlier use of defibrillation, the use of high-dose epinephrine when standard doses fail, the assessment of resuscitative efforts with end-tidal CO2 monitoring and the addition of two new drugs, amiodarone (for refractory ventricular fibrillation) and adenosine (for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia). Time will determine the ultimate role of these advancements in the management of cardiac arrest. 
5	Genetics and biology of human ovarian teratomas. II. Molecular analysis of origin of nondisjunction and gene-centromere mapping of chromosome I markers. Chromosomal heteromorphisms and DNA polymorphisms have been utilized to identify the mechanisms that lead to formation of human ovarian teratomas and to construct a gene-centromere map of chromosome 1 by using those teratomas that arise by meiotic nondisjunction. Of 61 genetically informative ovarian teratomas, 21.3% arose by nondisjunction at meiosis I, and 39.3% arose by meiosis II nondisjunction. Eight polymorphic marker loci on chromosome 1p and one marker on 1q were used to estimate a gene-centromere map. The results show clear linkage of the most proximal 1p marker (NRAS) and the most proximal 1q marker (D1S61) to the centromere at a distance of 14 cM and 20 cM, respectively. Estimated gene-centromere distances suggest that, while recombination occurs normally in ovarian teratomas arising by meiosis II errors, ovarian teratomas arising by meiosis I nondisjunction have altered patterns of recombination. Furthermore, the estimated map demonstrates clear evidence of chiasma interference. Our results suggest that ovarian teratomas can provide a rapid method for mapping genes relative to the centromere. 
5	Silent ischemia after coronary angioplasty: evaluation of restenosis and extent of ischemia in asymptomatic patients by tomographic thallium-201 exercise imaging and comparison with symptomatic patients. One hundred sixteen patients were evaluated to determine the ability of single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) thallium-201 exercise and redistribution imaging to detect silent ischemia secondary to restenosis in asymptomatic patients after single and multiple vessel percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and the findings were compared with SPECT imaging detection of restenosis in symptomatic patients. The value of exercise electrocardiography (ECG) and the amount of ischemic myocardium in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were determined. Forty-one patients were asymptomatic after angioplasty; 77% of these had chest pain before angioplasty. Seventy-five patients had chest pain after angioplasty; 99% of these had chest pain before angioplasty. Restenosis occurred in 61% of asymptomatic and 59% of symptomatic patients and in 46% of the vessels in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detection of restenosis by SPECT in individual patients were 96%, 75% and 88% versus 91%, 77% and 85%, respectively, in the asymptomatic versus symptomatic groups (p = NS). Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for restenosis detection in individual vessels were 90%, 89% and 89% versus 84%, 77% and 84%, respectively, in the asymptomatic and symptomatic groups (p = NS), with similar results for the three major arteries. Sensitivity and accuracy of exercise ECG were significantly less than those of SPECT imaging for the patients with silent (40% and 44%) and symptomatic (59% and 64%) ischemia (p less than 0.001). Restenosis of vessels in the patients with silent and symptomatic ischemia was associated with an equal amount and degree of severity of ischemic myocardium in the two groups. 
1	The relationship of ABH(O) blood group antigen expression in intraepithelial dysplastic lesions to clinicopathologic properties of associated transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Paraffin-embedded, giant-step sections of 13 bladders with transitional cell carcinomas were stained with monoclonal anti-A or anti-B antibodies to investigate whether intraepithelial dysplastic lesions are related to obvious tumors. Normal and/or hyperplastic lesions were retained in only eight bladders; severe dysplasia and/or carcinoma in situ were found in all bladders except two. AB-antigen expression was retained in intraepithelial lesions of bladders with invasive carcinoma. Most intraepithelial lesions were AB-antigen negative in bladders with frequently recurrent tumors. In bladders with initially multiple tumors, AB-antigen expression was negative in almost one half of the intraepithelial lesions. Therefore, it appears likely that most multiple or recurrent bladder carcinomas arise from dysplastic cells in intraepithelial lesions which have acquired malignant potential; initially invasive tumors quickly develop from a limited lesion acquiring a high malignant potential without changes of cell phenotype in most intraepithelial lesions. 
4	Thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction. The 1980s has been a critical decade for the management of acute myocardial infarction (MI) because of the concentration in a very short time span of innovative results produced by a new generation of trials, in which thrombolysis has been the preeminent topic. The message coming from the results in the more than 50,000 patients included in the five key trials is simple and clear: thrombolysis, of any type, is the cornerstone of acute treatment of MI, and it works well to produce a very favorable epidemiologic picture. In the GISSI-2 trial, the nationwide adoption of a package of recommended treatments centered on thrombolysis for the overall population of patients with an acute MI has produced a relevant modification of the natural history of the disease, reducing the in-hospital mortality by about 40% in few years (from 13% to 8.8%). In particular, in the great majority of cases (patients aged less than 70 years in Killip class I with a first acute MI), the mortality has gone down to 3%, making a further reduction very hard to obtain with new drugs or strategies. In this context, we will discuss the concept of the relevance for clinical practice of obtaining even greater patency rates with new thrombolytic agents (hopefully more efficient and safe) or with new combinations of traditional agents. 
3	Topographic comparative study of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography in 34 children with tuberous sclerosis. A series of 34 children with confirmed tuberous sclerosis (TS) were studied prospectively by both EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at ages ranging from 5 months to 18 years. Size and topography of the cortical tubers were analyzed on axial and coronal views, in T2 sequences, and the large tubers greater than 10 mm were studied. In addition, EEG follow-up data were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty-six patients (76%) had both MRI large cortical tubers and EEG foci, 3 had normal EEG, 2 had normal MRI, and the remaining 3 had only small tubers. The number of large tubers was significantly related to EEG foci. A topographic MRI/EEG correspondence was observed for at least one tuber in 25 of the 26 patients, and correspondence was complete in 10 patients. Large cortical tubers without corresponding EEG foci were observed in 11 patients; these tubers mainly involved the frontal regions and were found before the patients were 2 years old. EEG foci without corresponding tubers were observed in 4 patients. In addition, secondary bilateral synchrony was preferentially observed in patients with frontal lesions and after the age of 2 years. These data confirm that the cortical tubers are epileptogenic and that their expression may be influenced by regional cortical maturation. 
1	Gastric juice ascorbic acid: effects of disease and implications for gastric carcinogenesis. N-nitroso compounds (NOC) are strongly implicated in the causation of cancer of the stomach and it has been suggested that ascorbic acid might reduce the risk of gastric cancer by preventing their formation within gastric juice. However, until recently there have been no measurements of gastric juice ascorbic acid concentrations. We have measured both gastric juice ascorbic and total vitamin C (ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid). Our findings suggest that ascorbic acid is secreted into the gastric lumen so that gastric juice concentrations are often greater than those in plasma. Gastric pathology affects this secretion, leading to values in gastric juice that are lower than plasma levels. Stimulation of gastric secretion does not raise vitamin C concentrations in individuals whose values are initially low. The role of ascorbic acid in preventing formation of NOC and protecting against gastric cancer is discussed in the light of these findings. 
4	Risk factors for carotid artery stenosis: an epidemiological study of men aged 69 years. Four hundred and seventy-eight men born in 1914 and residing in the city of Malmo, Sweden, underwent ultrasonic Doppler examination of the carotid arteries in 1982/83. The known risk factors for vascular disease--blood pressure, lipids, glucose, hematocrit, alcohol consumption and Body Mass Index were also measured. A moderate stenosis (diameter reduction 30-59%) of the internal carotid artery was found in 95 men (20%); 15 men (3%) had a greater than or equal to 60% stenosis of the internal carotid artery, while 7 (1.5%) had complete unilateral occlusion. Smoking was found to be significantly related to severe carotid artery disease. There was also a significant correlation between maximum flow velocity in the internal carotid artery and triglycerides. Those quitting smoking before the age of 50 had the same incidence of internal carotid artery disease as non-smokers, while those quitting later in life had a slightly higher incidence than life-long smokers. 
5	Follow-up results of balloon angioplasty of native coarctation in neonates and infants. The purpose of this study is to present intermediate-term results of balloon angioplasty of native aortic coarctation in neonates and infants less than 1 year of age. During a 60-month-period that ended in January 1990, 19 infants ages 3 days to 12 months (median, 2.5 months), underwent balloon angioplasty of native coarctation with resultant reduction in peak-to-peak systolic pressure gradient from 39 +/- 12 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) to 11 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and increase in coarctation segment size from 2.2 +/- 0.8 mm to 4.7 +/- 1.0 mm. None required immediate surgical intervention. Thirteen of the 19 (68%) had severe associated cardiac defects. There was one death (5%) 2 days after balloon angioplasty, and it was related to associated cardiac defect. One infant was lost to follow-up. It is too soon to restudy one infant. The remaining 16 infants had clinical (36 +/- 18 months) and catheterization (12 +/- 4 months) follow-up data. The residual coarctation gradient (22 +/- 15 mm Hg) and coarcted segment size (4.4 +/- 1.6 mm) remain improved (p less than 0.01) when compared with pre-balloon angioplasty values. Five of the 16 (31%) infants (four were neonates at the time of balloon angioplasty) had evidence for recoarctation (defined as gradient greater than 20 mm Hg) and underwent surgical resection (two) or repeat balloon angioplasty (three), all with success. None developed aneurysms. 
5	Hyponatremia-induced inhibition of magnocellular neurons causes stressor-selective impairment of stimulated adrenocorticotropin secretion in rats. Chronically hyponatremic rats were subjected to various stressors in order to evaluate the possible contribution of magnocellular neurons to the regulation of ACTH secretion, since such rats have markedly inhibited secretion and synthesis of magnocellular arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT). Stress caused by a novel environment or by insulin-induced hypoglycemia resulted in moderate increases in plasma ACTH, which were of similar magnitude in both hyponatremic and normonatremic rats, and these stressors caused no increase in plasma AVP and OT levels in either group of rats. However, when exposed to ether, hyponatremic rats exhibited a significantly blunted ACTH response compared to normonatremic controls (331 +/- 49 vs. 740 +/- 124 pg/ml; P less than 0.01, respectively), and plasma AVP levels were markedly increased in the normonatremic, but not in the hyponatremic, rats. Intravenous infusion of 2 M NaCl also caused an ACTH release in hyponatremic rats that was significantly smaller than that in their normonatremic counterparts (228 +/- 52 vs. 479 +/- 85 pg/ml; P less than 0.05, respectively), and in this case both plasma AVP and OT levels were markedly increased in the normonatremic, but not in the hyponatremic, rats. However, hyponatremic rats exhibited greatly increased plasma ACTH levels 2 and 96 h after adrenalectomy (ADX), which were statistically equivalent to the increases in ACTH levels in normonatremic rats after ADX. Seven days after ADX parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus showed strongly increased CRF-41 and AVP-neurophysin, but not OT-neurophysin, immunoreactivities in both normonatremic and hyponatremic rats. These results show that parvocellular CRF-41/AVP-producing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus are not inhibited by chronic hyponatremia, in contrast to magnocellular neurons, and suggest that ACTH secretion induced by ether or hypertonic saline, but not by novel environment or insulin-induced hypoglycemia, is partially mediated by magnocellular AVP and/or OT. 
5	Referred pain of muscular origin resembling endodontic involvement. Case report. Referred pain is common in the orofacial region and can cause considerable difficulties in diagnosis. Referred pain is defined as pain that is referred to a part of the body other than the site of origin, and as a result, severe pain may arise without an associated causative lesion. A muscular trigger point that resembled a tooth with endodontic involvement is discussed. 
5	Decreased ventilation and hypoxic ventilatory responsiveness are not reversed by naloxone in Lhasa residents with chronic mountain sickness. Persons with chronic mountain sickness (CMS) hypoventilate and are more hypoxemic than normal individuals, but the cause of the hypoventilation is unclear. Studies of 14 patients with CMS and 11 healthy age-matched control subjects residing in Lhasa, Tibet, China (3,658 m) were conducted to test the hypothesis that hypoventilation, blunted hypoxic ventilatory responsiveness (HVR), and hypoxic ventilatory depression of CMS were due to increased endogenous opioid production. Patients with CMS compared with control subjects exhibited hypoventilation (end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure [PETCO2] = 36.6 +/- 1.0 versus 31.5 +/- 0.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), lower tidal volume (VT = 0.54 +/- 0.02 versus 0.61 +/- 0.02 ml BTPS, p less than 0.05), blunted HVR (shape parameter A = 17 +/- 8 versus 114 +/- 22 mm Hg/L BTPS/min, p less than 0.05), and a depressant effect of ambient hypoxia on ventilation (delta PETCO2 with acute hyperoxia = -3.5 +/- 0.5 versus -1.0 +/- 0.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 s to vital capacity ratios (FEV1/VC) and a higher proportion of cigarette smokers in the group of patients with CMS compared with control subjects suggested that at least some patients with CMS had mild airway obstructive lung disease. Naloxone infusion (0.14 mg/kg) to six patients with CMS did not change resting VT, PETCO2, HVR, or SaO2. 
1	Insulin-like growth factor binding protein secretion by breast carcinoma cell lines: correlation with estrogen receptor status. Breast tumor cell lines have been shown to secrete several distinct polypeptide growth factors, although conflicting results exist for the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). In contrast a limited number of breast tumor cell lines have definitely been shown to secrete the high affinity IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) that modify IGF actions. To characterize the types of IGFBPs that are secreted by breast tumor cell lines, conditioned medium was collected from seven separate tumor cell lines, three of which were estrogen receptor (ER) negative, and four of which were ER positive. All three of the ER negative cell lines, MDA-231, MDA-330, and HS578T, secreted binding proteins of 49,000 and 43,000 Mr (IGFBP-3) as well as 29,000 (IGFBP-1) and 24,000 Mr. In contrast, all four ER positive cell lines secreted 34,000 (IGFBP-2) or 24,000 Mr forms, and none secreted the 49,000 and 43,000 or 29,000 Mr forms. BT-20, a cell line that is positive for ER messenger RNA (mRNA) but negative for ER protein, secreted predominantly a 34,000 Mr protein. The amount of total IGFBP activity released in 24 h ranged between 0.4 and 5.6 nM equivalents of IGFBP-1, and there was no significant difference between the ER positive and negative cell lines. The MCF-7 cells that produced predominantly 34,000 and 24,000 Mr forms showed a 1.8-fold increase in IGFBP secretion after estrogen stimulation. Immunoblotting and a specific RIA for IGFBP-1 showed that only the ER negative lines MDA-330, MDA-231, and HS578T secreted this form. Northern blotting analysis for the mRNA encoding this protein showed that both MDA-330 and MDA-231 contained a single 1.6 kilobase mRNA species that hybridized with an IGFBP-1 complementary DNA (cDNA) probe. Immunoblotting analysis of the other cell lines showed that only the 34,000 Mr form secreted by the ER positive cell lines reacted with IGFBP-2 antisera. Exposure of the conditioned media from the three ER negative cell lines to N-glycanase revealed that the 49,000 and 43,000 Mr forms of IGFBP were glycosylated and therefore probably represent IGFBP-3. We conclude that ER negative cell lines secrete three forms of IGFBPs, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-3, and a 24,000 Mr form. In contrast, the ER positive cell lines secrete predominantly IGFBP-2 and the 24,000 Mr form but do not secrete IGFBP-3 or 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
4	Biobehavioral factors in Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study (CAPS). Review and examination. The behavioral studies component of the multicenter Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study (CAPS) was designed to examine the relation of biobehavioral factors and frequency of ventricular premature complexes (VPCs), efficacy of antiarrhythmic therapy, and disease end points in a study population that had experienced recent myocardial infarction and significant ventricular ectopy. Biobehavioral factors included both psychosocial (depression, anxiety, social support, type A behavior, mood, defensiveness, and anger expressiveness) and psychophysiological (heart rate and blood pressure reactivity to a videogame stressor) variables. Data were collected at baseline and at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups. Of the 502 patients enrolled in CAPS, 353 participated in the behavioral studies component. At baseline, assessments of psychosocial variables revealed the CAPS study population to be generally similar to other heart disease populations, and no relation between these variables and psychophysiological reactivity or arrhythmias was found. At follow-up among patients assigned to the placebo condition, biobehavioral variables were not related to levels of VPCs or VPC suppression. Cox regression analyses revealed that type B behavior, depression, and reduced heart rate reactivity were associated with increased clinical events, even after controlling for baseline left ventricular ejection fraction, myocardial infarction before the qualifying event, use of beta-blockers, use of digitalis, Q wave of qualifying myocardial infarction, and presence of unsustained ventricular tachycardia on baseline electrocardiogram. It is hypothesized that the relation among reduced heart rate reactivity, depression, and clinical events is mediated by diminished cardiac vagal tone. 
4	Acute pulmonary oedema following administration of ornithine-8-vasopressin. We report the case of a patient who developed acute pulmonary oedema following a short and uneventful surgical procedure. Among the differential diagnoses, the role of ornithine-8-vasopressin is emphasized. 
5	Evaluation of current extrication orthoses in immobilization of the unstable cervical spine. An experiment was designed to evaluate the comparative stabilizing efficacy of several widely used semi-rigid orthoses applied to unstable fresh cadaver cervical spines subject to load. Cadaver specimens were surgically destabilized at the C4-5 segment. Lateral radiographs of the destabilized spine were obtained before and after collar placement and after the application of a 5-pound flexion force. Data analysis employing a one-way analysis of variance showed no statistically significant difference in the Necloc's, Philadelphia Collar's, or the Stifneck's ability to stabilize the cervical spine against a deforming flexion force (P greater than 0.05). They all provide translational stability while allowing angular changes to occur with application of the flexion force. The Philadelphia Collar Halo System is statistically superior to all three of the aforementioned collars in prevention of both translation and sagittal rotation (P less than 0.05). 
4	Primary repair for complete atrioventricular canal: recommendation for early primary repair. Forty patients with complete atrioventricular canal (CAVC) underwent primary repair at Fukuoka Children's Hospital in Fukuoka, Japan, between August 1, 1981 and July 31, 1989. The age at repair ranged from 2 months to 6 years (mean 19 months); weight ranged from 2.3 to 22 kg. The surgical mortality was 2.5%. Justification for early primary repair was examined. Eleven patients underwent repair before 6 months of age (Group 1), 12 patients, between 7 and 11 months of age (Group 2), and 17 patients, after 12 months of age (Group 3). Degenerative changes in the atrioventricular valve increased significantly as age at repair increased (p less than 0.05 Group 1 versus Group 3). The incidence of residual mitral regurgitation tended to increase in the order of Group 1, 2 and 3, though the degree ranged from trivial to mild. Study of the left atrium/aorta ratio by echocardiography revealed that stable values of around 1.1 in Groups 1 and 2 and around 1.3 in Group 3 continued during the follow-up period of 3 years. Assessment of the diameter of the repaired mitral valve in the mean interval of 26 months in groups 1 and 2 revealed normal growth of the mitral valve annulus. The angle between the repaired mitral valve and ventricular septum, which can be affected by the growth of the ventricular septum, converged to normal range in the mean interval of 26 months. Postoperative pulmonary vascular resistance in Groups 2 and 3 was higher at 4.4 +/- 2.3 and 6.3 +/- 2.2, respectively, than in Group 1 at 3.3 +/- 2.2 (p less than 0.01 versus Group 3). 
2	Selective intestinal decontamination prevents spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In a prospective randomized study, selective intestinal decontamination with norfloxacin was performed during hospitalization in 32 cirrhotic patients with low ascitic fluid total protein levels. The incidence of infections was compared with that in a control group of 31 nontreated cirrhotic patients of similar characteristics. We found a significantly lower incidence of infections [1/32 (3.1%) vs. 13/31 (41.9%); P less than 0.005] and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [0/32 (0%) vs. 7/31 (22.5%); P less than 0.05] in patients receiving norfloxacin. The lower incidence of extraperitoneal infections [1/32 (3.1%) vs. 7/31 (22.5%); P = 0.052] in the treated group did not reach statistical significance. The incidence of infections [1/28 (3.6%) vs. 9/22 (40.9%); P less than 0.01] and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [0/28 (0%) vs. 5/22 (22.7%); P less than 0.05] in cirrhotic patients admitted because of ascites was also significantly lower in the treated group. The decrease in the rate of mortality observed in the group undergoing selective intestinal decontamination did not reach statistical significance. These data show that selective intestinal decontamination is useful to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and extraperitoneal infections in hospitalized cirrhotic patients with low ascitic fluid total protein levels. 
5	Intestinal ischemia complicating abdominal aortic surgery. A 9-year experience with 2137 patients undergoing infrarenal abdominal aortic reconstruction was reviewed to determine both the incidence of intestinal ischemia and the clinical, anatomic, and technical factors associated with this complication of aortic surgery. A total of 24 (1.1%) patients had overt intestinal ischemia, documented by reoperation or endoscopic findings. Of these, colon ischemia occurred in 19 (0.9%) and small bowel ischemia developed in 5 (0.2%) patients. The incidence after elective operation for aneurysmal or occlusive disease did not differ, but patients with ruptured aneurysms and those undergoing reoperative procedures for total graft replacement were at higher risk. Preoperative angiography was most helpful in ascertaining risk. Ligation of a patent inferior mesenteric artery was the most common (74%) feature in patients with colon ischemia. With preexisting inferior mesenteric artery occlusion, impairment of collateral circulation was attributable to superior mesenteric artery disease, dissection or retractor injury, prior colon resection, or exclusion of hypogastric perfusion. Bloody diarrhea was the most frequent postoperative symptom and colonoscopy the most reliable means of diagnosis. One half of patients with colon ischemia required resection after late recognition of perforation. All cases of small bowel ischemia were related to superior mesenteric artery disease or injury or use of suprarenal clamping. The overall mortality rate was 25% but rose to 50% if bowel resection was required. Intestinal ischemia remains an infrequent but serious complication of aortic surgery. Despite a multifactorial cause, identification of patients at increased risk can lead to operative strategies to reduce its occurrence. 
1	Simultaneous presentation of adenocarcinoma of prostate and transitional cell carcinoma of bladder. Simultaneous presentation of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and adenocarcinoma of the prostate is not uncommon. Twenty-two patients were diagnosed as having simultaneous or concurrent presentation of prostate and bladder carcinomas between January 1970 and July 1986. The overall five-year survival was 40 percent, with patients presenting with prostate cancer doing better (50%) than those with bladder cancer (32%). Retrospective review of these cases suggests that primary therapy should be directed to the most advanced cancer. Incidental prostate cancer may be "cured" with a cystoprostatectomy and, when indicated, radiation therapy added postoperatively for the bladder cancer. Eleven patients presented with Stage A prostate cancer: 10 of the 11 were treated for their bladder cancer. Treatment was usually radical cystoprostatectomy with or without postoperative radiation. None died of prostate cancer. Patients presenting with advanced stage prostate cancer have had recurrence or have died of the cancer. 
5	Acute appendicitis in the pregnant patient. Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical problem in pregnancy requiring emergent intervention. To establish a contemporary patient profile and formulate an effective management strategy, a retrospective review was conducted of 84 pregnant patients who underwent laparotomy with a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Gestational stage at presentation included the first trimester in 27 patients (32%), the second trimester in 37 patients (44%), the third trimester in 13 patients (16%), and the puerperium in 7 patients (8%). Fifty-four patients (64%) had pathologically proven acute appendicitis; the incidence did not vary by trimester. Other intra-abdominal conditions were detected in 15 patients (18%). There were no significant differences between patients with positive and negative laparotomies (or among trimesters) regarding frequency of presenting symptoms and signs or laboratory results. Operation occurred within 24 hours of symptom onset in 19 of 54 (35%) instances of proven acute appendicitis. Perforation occurred in 23 of 54 patients (43%), all of whom had symptoms exceeding 24 hours (p less than 0.0005). Five instances of perinatal death and one case of extreme perinatal morbidity were associated with negative laparotomies; only one of these was attributed to operation itself. No adverse long-term maternal morbidity or mortality occurred. Wound infection developed in seven cases of acute appendicitis (six perforated) and two negative explorations. We conclude that (1) gestational physiologic changes obscure the accurate diagnosis of acute appendicitis; (2) the natural history of acute appendicitis is not affected by trimester of presentation; and (3) adverse sequelae of acute appendicitis are obviated by prompt operative exploration and prevention of appendiceal perforation. 
2	Preoperative stabilisation in congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Between January 1983 and November 1986, 26 newborn infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia were treated by early operation at a mean of 7 hours of age. A further 23 infants admitted between December 1986 and December 1989 were stabilised for a mean period of 40 hours before operation. There was no significant difference in survival between the two groups. Delayed operation is not detrimental to infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. 
1	Clinicopathological experience with pineocytomas: report of five surgically treated cases. The clinicopathological experience associated with five cases of pineocytoma is presented. All patients were treated by surgical removal without postoperative radiotherapy. In three individuals, 2000 cGy was administered to the tumor as a presurgical diagnostic test, with no evidence of response. All cases demonstrated histological features of pineocytoma, according to the criteria of Borit et al., and of the so-called "pineocytoma with neuronal differentiation," according to the criteria of Rubinstein. The experience obtained from the present series reveals that these tumors can occur in the initial decades of life, that a cystic appearance and the presence of calcifications are distinctive features of their radiological evaluation, and that they have a good prognosis after surgical removal, even when the histological data indicate local invasion. The convenience of reserving the term "pineocytoma" for these tumors, and of including the so-called "pineocytomas without further differentiation" within the group of pineoblastomas, is suggested in order to achieve a practical clinicopathological assessment of parenchymatous pineal tumors. 
5	A huge intracranial xanthogranuloma in the middle cranial fossa: case report. Xanthogranulomas of the dura presenting with clinical symptoms are rare. We report here a case of a huge dural xanthogranuloma in the middle cranial fossa, which caused hemiparesis through marked displacement and stenosis of the middle cerebral artery. Although such tumors usually arise in association with histiocytosis X or familial hyperlipoproteinemia, the present case was not associated with these diseases. 
5	Histology of the lens in the Weill-Marchesani syndrome. The Weill-Marchesani syndrome is a rare systemic connective tissue disease characterised by small stature, brachydactyly, ectopia lentis, and spherophakia. Three siblings with typical manifestations of this syndrome were reported. The ophthalmological findings in all these cases were spherophakia, severe myopia, a shallow anterior chamber, and narrow angle glaucoma. Two cases underwent laser iridotomy and drug treatment. In the third case the lens was removed from the eye because of injury, and this lens was examined by light and electron microscopy. 
5	Interphase cytogenetic analysis in the diagnosis and study of neoplastic disorders. Cytogenetic information usually is obtained through the direct analysis of chromosomes from cells arrested in metaphase. Recently, advances in molecular genetics have made it possible to acquire cytogenetic information through the study of interphase and terminally differentiated cells. By using chromosome-specific DNA probes or probes that are specific for certain chromosomal regions, and by employing techniques of in situ hybridization along with nonradioactive detection methods, it is now possible to detect numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities from nonmetaphase cells. When used as an adjunct to conventional cytogenetic analysis or when used together with knowledge of established cytogenetic findings for a particular malignancy, this new technology can serve to broaden the scope and utility of cytogenetic analysis beyond the limits of the present metaphase-based technology. Interphase cytogenetic analysis has application to the diagnosis and study of neoplastic disorders and, thus, has particular importance in pathology. 
4	Comparison of lisinopril versus atenolol for mild to moderate essential hypertension. The antihypertensive effects and safety profiles of lisinopril (10 to 40 mg) and atenolol (50 to 100 mg) were compared in a randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 144 patients with essential hypertension. After 8 weeks of therapy, seated blood pressure (BP) decreased by 26/15 mm Hg with lisinopril and by 19/14 mm Hg with atenolol. Lisinopril produced a greater reduction (p less than 0.05) in sitting systolic BP than did atenolol. Standing BP decreased by 25/15 mm Hg with lisinopril and by 19/14 mm Hg with atenolol. No important changes in hematologic and biochemical profiles were seen with either drug. Eleven patients, 7 receiving lisinopril and 4 receiving atenolol, were withdrawn because of adverse experiences; another 3 patients defaulted during treatment, 1 in the lisinopril group and 2 in the atenolol group. Both drugs were well-tolerated and are therefore suitable for first-line therapy in essential hypertension. 
5	Dysgeusia, gustatory sweating, and crocodile tears syndrome induced by a cerebellopontine angle meningioma. Facial nerve involvement in cerebellopontine angle tumors, both during their development and after excision, may be expressed in irreversible dysfunction of the parasympathetic pathways. The exact location of the lesion along the efferent nerve fibers can be established through evaluation of the functional level of those organs supplied by the cholinergic motor secretory components. This report deals with a female patient in whom peripheral facial palsy developed shortly after removal of a right cerebellopontine angle meningioma. She had slight facial asymmetry and deafness in the right ear and complained of prandial flush and sweating of the right malar area. Occult ipsilateral hyposalivation and hypolacrimation were diagnosed. In patients with seventh and ninth cranial nerve pathoses, evaluation of the end organs that are supplied by their associated autonomous nerve fibers is mandatory to prevent late ocular and oral sequelae. 
4	Mapping of the locus for X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy with neutropenia and abnormal mitochondria (Barth syndrome) to Xq28. X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy with neutropenia and abnormal mitochondria is clinically characterized by congenital dilated cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, recurrent bacterial infections, and growth retardation. We analyzed linkage between the disease locus and X-chromosomal markers in a family with seven carriers, four patients, and eight unaffected sons of carriers. Highest lod scores obtained by two-point linkage analysis were 2.70 for St14.1 (DXS52, TaqI) at a recombination fraction of zero and 2.53 for cpX67 (DXS134) at a recombination fraction of zero. Multipoint linkage analysis resulted in a maximum lod score of 5.24 at the position of St35.691 (DXS305). The most distal recombination detected in this family was located between the markers II-10 (DXS466) and DX13 (DXS15). These data indicate the location of the mutated gene at Xq28.
