@@ We walked through Nickelodeon Universe , up some escalators and to the food court . We had an idea to seat people by favorite pony , but the group was just too massive and we could n't organize it quick enough , so we just went ahead and ate . This took up a good amount of time , though ! So , to make up for what we wanted to make as an ice-breaking lunch , we decided to gather in a circle and have everyone go one by one , saying their name , favorite pony and any added stuff . We really had to yell in order for anyone to hear ! The guards were watching us , but let us finish up ... Right after this was probably a lot of peoples ' favorite part : pony-izing the Best Buy computers ! Eventually we had everything from episodes , to fanfics to Equestria Daily up . Eventually we left when the staff started getting annoyed , though . ; ; Then we wandered around , got some free sample cheese , went to a magnet store , to Gamestop and to Barnes And Noble . I had to leave right after Barnes And Noble , but I heard that everyone gathered around to watch Sonic Rainboom on a laptop and went to Buffalo Wild Wings for dinner at five ! Again , everyone had a fun time and we 're hoping to do another meet-up sometime soon ! If you 're a Minnesotan brony and would like to suggest ideas for another meet or just get information and talk to other bronies in the area , our RDN group is here : http : **33;57;TOOLONG Thanks for attending , guys ! c : "

@@77555643 @6255643/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> You know , I 've done some things I regret during my time writing for Equestria Daily . I mean , not a lot of things , mind you . Mostly little stuff here and there , in like a petty-office-politics , LONG ... kind of way . Y'know , nothing major . <p> But lately , as you mayhave noticed , things have started getting a little out of control . On top of having a boss to bribe and a blog staff to constantly pretend I have the proper credentials to do this job in front of , now I 've got a stuffy , pencil-pushing technically just made up for my own amusement blog mascot on my case every time I come in for a followup . <p> Well , not this time , Spotlight . You may have mildly inconvenienced me in the land of tiny magic horses , but we 're in my house now , Miss Splash--and in this neck of the woods , I 'm the one with my hands on the wheel . ( Literally . Hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equestria Girls : Legend of Everfree movie followup , and just to confirm this for my dear little pony friend 's sake : you ai n't in Kantersas anymore , Spots . Let 's get paddlin ' . <p> The wondrous splendor of unspoiled nature is no substitute for fashion sense , AJ . And/or ending sentences with " darling " instead of a period . <p> Enid Raye Adams and Brain Doe ( no relation to John or Jane , I presume ) make their Equestria Girls debut in this movie as Gloriosa Daisy and Timber Spruce , respectively , but for one of the this actually is n't the first time they 've been involved with the MLP franchise--in our chronology as viewers , anyway . Turns out , Enid had a cameo earlier in Season 6 as one half of the Whinnyapolis-hailing couple who visited The Tasty Treat in " Spice Up Your Life " . Extrapolate wildly about long-lost twins across interdimensional borders as you will . <p> " Princess Celestia ? Now there 's a name I have n't heard in a long time . Multiple seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit surprised to see that Sci-Twi 's version of Spike retained his ability to speak from Friendship Games . Wonder if that makes picking up after him on walks more awkward or less . <p> Human Pinkie Pie : Element of Exposition <p> Its not like its unexpected , per se , but I appreciate Sunsets buddy-buddy attitude towards Sci-Twi even this early on . What with transferring to a new school on top of the whole Midnight Sparkle thing to deal with , its got ta be nice to have a fellow former magical-demon-spawn in your corner . <p> " So Human Flash has a crush on Pony Twilight , but Pony Twilight has a crush on Pony Flash who does n't even know any of this is going on , and you 're technically Pony Sunset but no one knows where Human Sunset is or whether she even exists ? " " It 's better if you do n't think about it . At all . Ever . " <p> You wipe that look right off your face , Sentry . Bulk Biceps ' mom is and continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Lunas got on a practical outfit garnished with a couple bits of camp memorabilia , and then there 's Principal C next to her covered in more merit badges than a Boy Scout in ROTC . When it comes to repping the map-reading and underwater basket-weaving disciplines , Celly do n't  play . <p> Small point of note : far be it from me to call someone else unsubtle , but the stones on Gloriosas necklace matching the Humane 7 ( minus Sci-Twi and Sunset for now ) in color is a bit of a giveaway for where this whole thing is headed . Additional point of note : " Humane 7 " is a thing other people besides me say , right ? <p> " Talk nerdy to me , Timber-senpai " <p> Filthy Rich as the first visible antagonist makes sense on the surface , but it feels weird on second thought given that he s portrayed in the show as being a generally okay guy . Then again , weve only really seen him act that way around longtime business partners in the Apple family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act a little more abrasive when negotiating with other folks . <p> It also would n't be crazy to wonder where in the blueberry-flavored flapjack Diamond Tiara is if her dads got such a vested interest in the camp , but you would n't know it from Hasbros apparent feelings on the matter , now would you ? <p> One of the things that I think goes often underappreciated about Sunset Shimmer is her skill at mediation . The same talent for social manipulation that she used to terrorize her classmates back in the first movie has now evolved into one more suited for chipping through her friends mental walls and keeping them all together as a group . It gives her a really well-defined role amongst the EqG crew , which is a big part of what makes her so much fun to watch . <p> The fact that her feelings on magical rainbow lasers match mine is just icing on the cake . <p> Somebody call Disney . I 've found another popular franchise for them to buy out . <p> Do n't  think I did n't  notice Flash chatting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sci-Twi heads out onto the dock for the first time , by the way . The rest of you might be focusing on things like the background scenery or actual plot of the film , but rest assured Im zeroed in on the stuff that really matters . <p> Semi-related : I 've always kind of wanted to try out the pickup line Timber uses here on a girl falling into me , but I 've never gotten the chance as , regrettably , I do n't  live in a cartoon . Fair play , T-dog . <p> And while were on the subject of reeeeeally stretching for romantic connection , check out these two somehow-not-awkward exes . <p> " Are you sure its a good idea to trust a bunch of teenagers with power tools and a large-scale construction project , Celestia ? " " Aw , cmon , Luna , itll be fine ! I mean , what 's the worst thing that 's ever happened in a movie set at a summer camp ? " <p> To paraphrase Rarity from thirty seconds ago : " You say tomato , I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even close . " <p> For real , though , even Snips and Snails got to tag along . Did the CMC just have jury duty this week or something ? Which I guess could conceivably be possible if numerical age in EqG-Land is vague and wibbly-wobbly as it seems ? <p> " A long time ago , before the Kaleidoscopia virus gave us all technicolor skin " <p> " Howdy , folks . Names Gaia . County-appointed Speaker for the Trees . Got a partner out near Whoville , little orange guy , looks like Danny DeVito with less body hair ? You might have heard of him . " <p> Leave it to Rarity to forget for the third movie in a row that idly listing off the screwups of formerly evil friends is a bit of a social no-no . <p> Between the multiple dream sequences and the first song number that follows close behind them , its really aggressively hammered home how messed up Sci-Twi is over the end of Friendship Games . Sunset certainly had some similar struggles after her own transmorgrification , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's an extreme semantic position to take , but its definitely fair to say that this redemption arc is tinged a shade darker than the ones we 've seen prior to now . <p> Well , look on the bright side : its not the worst thing your roommate could wake up to see you unconsciously doing . <p> I cant decide what 's better : the attempt by " Muffins " to blow them across the lake , or Tokes McGee back there 's total conviction that settling on that course of action will probably work out fine . <p> I 'm not going to dignify that Trixie bit with a screencap . I know the result of a written demand from Seth tacked to the front of Hasbro HQ with a bowie knife when I see it . <p> In any event , I do n't  think this is the kind of reflection Mulan was singing about . ( Also , still waiting on that opening offer , Disney . ) <p> Okay , I 've held off on this long enough : exactly how old is Timber Spruce ? I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp counselor since he literally grew up at this camp , but unless he s still in high school or this is secretly a graduation trip , some part of this whole deal is no bueno . Had to be said at least once . <p> Belay training , schmelay training . What 's really important is that we had fun and , if you do n't  count the second-degree rope burns on AJs hands , nobody got hurt . <p> And all of a sudden , the Equestria Girls Justice League is open for business . There 's a lot of LONG ... on display in a relatively short period of time here , but its worth noting that a couple of the Humane 7s abilities match up with those of the Power Ponies back in Season 4--although to be fair , Raritys Purple Lantern constructs are a little less intricate here , and Rainbow Dash rather appropriately ended up with super speed instead of Pinkie , who this time around gets exploding sprinkles . To each their own , I guess . <p> Anyway , now that we have both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7s powers seem to match up much more closely with each characters personality , most likely because they 're more or less magical horse women versions of what their pony selves can already do . Regardless , this is basically MLPs version of the Avengers , and that 's enough metaphorical coal to get my personal hype train chugging . <p> Maybe keep Pinkie Pie away from the lighter fluid all the same , though . Just to be safe . <p> " Did you just w-what did you see ? " " Nothing ! I mean , just plot-relevant stuff . Mostly . " " So not my browser history ? " " Um sure . Let 's run with that . " <p> I know Sci-Twis the focal character for a majority of the movie , but I 'm seeing a fair bit of progress for Sunset as well . Being able to own her past to the point that she can bring it up as advice for another friend is yet another step beyond even the end of her road to redemption . I suppose its once again something that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonetheless . Which is fine , by the way . And normal . And a totally balanced and reasonable to view Shimmy as a character . <p> B-Baka . <p> Human Pinkie Pie : Element of Near-Lethal Dosages of Ketamine <p> So now that the gals have learned to use their powers for good or whatever highly effective dock-building , several new mysteries emerge . Do different flavors of sprinkles create bigger Pink-splosions ? Does Rainbow have to wear special non-chafing clothing so her pants do n't  catch on fire when she Sonic-speeds it up ? Is Sunset channeling Shania Twain with this song , or am I just reaching for ever-more-nebulous ways in which I semi-excessively love her ? <p> I feel like there 's an obvious answer to at least one of those questions , but its beyond me to figure out which . <p> Flash , meet Boulder . Boulder , Flash . You two ought a have a lot in common . <p> " All right , Spike , here 's the plan . Well all go into this isolated cave with the weird unearthly glow coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , well split up to cover more ground . Sound good ? " " You two really do n't  watch many movies set at summer camps , do you ? " <p> Even this far in , I keep hearing an " F " every time anyone says Gloriosas name . Certainly lends the second-act twist a slightly different type of dramatic tension . <p> What I find really interesting here is n't so much the revelation of the real " antagonist " , so to speak , but rather the fact that in a straightforward sense there really is n't one at all . FuriGloriosas definitely in over her head by this point , but her goal is clearly just to do right by her familys legacy without intentionally hurting anyone , and even Filthy Rich is n't trying to destroy the camp just out of spite or something equally petty . Sure , he s a bit of a jerk about the haggling process , but if the camps hemorrhaging money its not like wanting to buy the land out for development would be a nutty thing to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an exciting climax ( and does in this movie too ) , but the lack of any all-caps BAD guy in this scenario adds a nice extra inch of narrative depth . <p> Hope their next DIY camp improvement project is n't raising a barn , is all I can say . <p> You know , I stand by what I said before about Gloriosa and her good-intentions-paved personal road , but damned if this is n't a really villain-y villain song once Gaia-Lite takes over . Shades of Don Cheadles Captain Planet , almost . <p> I suppose this is just what happens when the powers of Earth , Fire , Water , Wind , and LONG ... combine . <p> Credit to Pinka Pank ( and Rarara , I guess ) for not dodging the " S " word when the outhouse tips over onto the A/C unit fan here . Edna Modes opinion be damned , sometimes superpowers just are n't  super enough without a majestic flowing cape and entirely too much spandex . <p> That being said , Butterballs got a point : if the first word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " super-duper fun " , maybe its time to rethink your life a tad . <p> You know what they say about horseshoes and handgrenades--if either one starts glowing in your hand , you should probably go ahead and throw it . <p> Usually when people say you can be anything you want , " a magical pony princess " is n't really one of the options , but hey , if the horn sprouts and the wings grow feathers <p> So here 's a less-than-contrived fan theory from me for once : Sunsets pony ears pop up while she 's pleading with Sci-Twi to use her magic on Gloriosas vines , but not when she uses her own magic like the rest of the Humane 7--instead , it happens at the exact moment she tells Twilight that they need to go rescue their friends . Between this little bit of convenient timing and the efficacy of her power at both finding out peoples hidden concerns and helping to overcome them , I think its possible that the Element of Magic/Friendship in this universe is n't Sci-Twi or even Princess Twilight back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it implies a lot about the nature of the Elements and their capacity to latch on to potentially more than one mortal bearer , as well as Sunsets role in the series going forward . Food for thought . <p> " Do n't  worry , Twilight . You 're not gon na turn evil again ! And I mean , even if you do , were kinda all screwed anyway , so might as well go for broke , yknow ? " <p> " See ? Told you itd work out . Cause this is totally , uh exactly what I expected to happen . Hundred percent . " <p> At some point we skipped past the superhero motif and veered hard northwest into Power Ranger territory , and I 'm not saying that 's necessarily a bad thing but I ai n't  gon na lie and act like these are n't  some bonkers-ass horseapples we got goin on up in here . <p> " Look , the apologys nice and all , Glory , but this is literally the fourth time we 've dealt with this kind of thing in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table , were really not in the mood . Just leave us your insurance information and the key to the counselor liquor cabinet , and well take it from there . Its kind of a routine for us at this point . " <p> I had a sinking feeling early on that theyd have to force a full band performance into this movie at some point , but to be honest , when it did happen at the end here it came off pretty well . The fundraiser to save the camp is enough of a reasonable raison detre to accept and move on from , and it does n't  hurt that the song itself is ( subjectively ) some of Daniel Ingrams best work . That 's at least partially the basshead part of talking , though , so I suppose your mileage may vary . <p> Cut Ponk some slack here . Sometimes its hard to know where you 'll be when the beat drops . <p> Presented almost without comment , except for a brief confirmation that I 've found my cosplay for Bronycon 2017 . <p> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " all that is the being of Timber Spruce " right alongside Flash Sentrys love life and whether Sunset will ever show up in the TV show , and just not talk about it . Good ? Good . Super . <p> Now do us and all the little kids watching at home a favor and get a tent , you two . <p> And with that , the camp is saved , the day is won , and Timber really just went for that grounder to first base , did n't  h no . No . Not talking about it . Right . In any event , for a direct-to-Netflix fourth entry in a humanized spinoff of My Little Pony , this whole thing came together rather well--and I mean that much more sincerely than I 'm making it sound . I know a lot of people had a lot of reservations about this series.when it first began , but by this point its truly established itself as an engaging extended world with--led by Sunset and Sci-Twi--an increasing strong alt-universe cast . Between the superpower pendants and Sci-Twis solidification as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of neat stuff to be explored going forward , and with it a lot of potential for future films in this universe to work out as well as this one did . <p> After some significant ups , downs , and growing pains , the Equestria Girls franchise seems to be finally hitting its stride . If Legend of Everfree represents a new normal for the quality of the series rather an entertaining exception to the rule ( and me from a few years ago would be shocked to hear me say this ) , then bring on EqG 5 . <p> Because real talk ? If you 're gon na end a movie with sequel bait , this is the way to do it .

Special thanks to our friends at IDW Publishing for bringing us the exclusive first look what 's going to be coming out this June ! <p> And it looks like there was a slight mix-up with the last solicitation for Legends of Magic . Apparently the subscription cover for this issue got mixed up with the subscription cover for issue 2 . I was kind of wondering why we had the old unicorn on a cover for a story starring the earth pony. 
@@77555663 @6255663/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> The pony train has arrived again , and while I slept off Babscon 's cuisine and reminded myself that I write for this site , Season Seven premiered last Saturday . We 've had numerousshakeups on the writing staff over the hiatus , and one of those placements was Joanna Lewis and Kristine Songco revealed as the writers of the premiere episodes , as well as the story editors for Season Seven . <p> After seeing the premiere , I 'm confident in this season despite some worrying losses . Let 's talk about why Joanna Lewis and Kristine Songco are the future for pony after the break . <p> With the premiere , much like many previous seasons , the show intended to do something new . The premiere , instead of being two interconnecting " Part 1 " and " Part 2 " stories , was simply two slice-of-life ( no not that one ) episodes . " Celestial Advice " gave us a look into one of the fandom 's most beloved characters : Princess Celestia by comparing Twilight 's current situation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bottled Up " is its own self-contained story that furthers Starlight 's character narrative in the same vein as " Every Little Thing She Does " by showing how talented she is at manipulation , and the subtle ways in which it can be intentionally or unintentionally practiced . Her magic is ruled by emotion , which can be a good or bad thing depending on its application . <p> These episodes are miles away from each other in scope , and I believe this is Season Seven 's way of showing us how they intend to differentiate this season among the others . Season Four ditched friendship letters in place of journals , as well as explored more side and secondary characters with the Friendship Keys . Season Five brought Starlight into the mix as well as planted the seeds for Twilight to become a mentor figure . Alongside this , we again had more side characters given some time in the spotlight , from Gilda to Princess Luna , to everyone in " Slice of Life " . Season Six furthered the intentions of Season Five , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their race , from Thorax to Ember and the final reformation of The Great and Powerful Trixie . Also something something Cutie Map . <p> What has Season Seven done ? Well , so far we 've been given more time to breathe with Starlight as a student , more time for Trixie to characterize herself , and even some very important flashbacks with Princess Celestia . Meanwhile , we 're given enjoyable scenes with the ManeMain Six that are clever , in-character , and at times deconstruct what the show has been practicing since its premiere . <p> " All Bottled Up " and " Celestial Advice " are excellent slice-of-life episodes , comedically , thematically , and narratively . As I 've said time and time again , My Little Pony can not afford to rest on its laurels with what the Main Six have done . They 're experienced Elements of Friendship with seasons of lessons behind them . But you know who does n't have that ? Everyone else . Starlight and Trixie are essentially blank slates , characters that are n't as complete as Twilight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulk Biceps do n't have their own episodes , but a simple scene or few lines can bring them to life , and the world along with them . <p> These two episodes are the pinnacle of when character research and writing experience connect into vibrant scripts . The one thing that can ruin a script is poor timing . Joanna Lewis and Kristine Songco do n't waste a minute in both episodes , and one of the reasons is because they utilize subplots to their full potential . Did we really gain much character-wise for the Main Six during their room escape ? I 'd argue no , apart from additions to their team dynamic which we do n't get much of unless there 's a villain of the week . But the room escape was there for a good reason . If all of that time spent among the Main Six was instead on Starlight and Trixie , the " bottling up " scenes would have worn their welcome twice as fast . Some could call this the " Games Ponies Play " problem , where the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's going to happen . <p> Subplots ( usually ) are used to pad out the story and suspense between the main plot and commercial breaks . Interestingly enough , the subplot contains the Main Six , while the main plot contains the secondary characters or villains of previous seasons . This split of plots can most likely be connected to Lewis and Songco 's work on T.U.F.F . Puppy , which had two disconnected 12 minute episodes per airing . Their experience is n't limited , however , considering the episodes they wrote before Season Seven ( Top Bolt , Rarity Investigates , Castle Sweet Castle ) did n't have subplots that were as pronounced . Those episodes were also excellent , so I 'd argue that Lewis and Songco are as ready as anyone else to hold the reins for this season . <p> @LadyWriters on Twitter if you want to tweet at them ! <p> The last thing I want to mention is that obviously , what Hasbro or DHX allows the show to do has changed over the seasons . There 's no doubting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing like she did with ( or misconstrued as at ) would have been allowed in Seasons One or Two . Not only that , but Joanna and Kristine are the story editors for this entire season , so it 's possible that they were given more leeway with the first two episodes since they were " premieres " . However , since the teasers for the nextfewepisodes seem to give us a mix of Main Six and secondary character focus , I 'm optimistic that this season will be excellent or perhaps better than the last ! <p> I 'm rooting for you both , Joanna and Kristine . Thank you and everyone on the staff , from Hasbro to DHX and down for giving us an excellent premiere . <p> And that 's it for me this week . Thank you for reading . What did you all think of this premiere ? Since Joanna and Kristine are confirmed for the entire season , are they ready to keep us entertained for the entire season ?

@@77555669 @6255669/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> Let 's take a look at this new comic and see how Equestria 's past takes form . <p> Find the review after the break , but watch out for long-lost spoilers ! <p> I 'll say this for Legends of Magic before even touching on the issue itself : I do n't envy its challenge . Despite the many aspects I enjoy about Friendship is Magic , its lore has struggled . I get the sense that much of it is being made up on the fly , and while it works to set up a single episode it might contradict itself down the line . There are vague notions of time with many questions left unanswered . <p> So for a comic line to try and flesh out Equestria 's history is a daunting task . When the 3-page preview came out , many fans pointed out that Reflections had established that Canterlot castle did not exist before the Castle of the Two Sisters . Opinions on the canon of comics has varied . If a contradiction does arise , I 'm inclined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are working closer with the show at this stage than several years ago . <p> Goodness , it really has been several years since that arc , has n't it ? Time flies ! <p> The artwork for this comic is very enjoyable . It manages to resemble the show without settling for imitation . Sometimes it 's the way a character moves or a look one never expected to see . Many of these moments come from a very young Princess Celestia . Luna 's younger form is familiar from Friendship is Magic 's premier , but I do n't think we 've seen Celestia presented this young before . In some panels I thought she resembled Princess Cadance . I mean that as a compliment as it hints that Cadance might also grow to resemble Celestia , as might Twilight . <p> Heather Breckel returns as colorist for these old and new settings . She conveys the mood of the setting well with Canterlot being bright and full of sunshine . The darker realm , which resembles the Everfree Forest , features an emphasis on black voids but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps convey that this land is filled with life , but there is nothing beneficial about it . <p> Must ... resist ... Evil Dead reference ! <p> Celestia 's mane is a special note . Throughout the comic we see she has the gradient of her holder self , but it 's not yet defined . Almost like she is not yet in balance . Yet as the Illustrious Q pointed out , the credits page depicts Celestia with a purely pink mane , much as fans have come to expect . I might be in the minority on this but I prefer the gradient as it says more about Celestia 's personality than a monotone mane . <p> Celestia is the true star of this comic . Though Luna will have some hinted development , it 's Celestia who features the most prominently and will undergo the greatest change . We get a hint of this as Celestia shows Sunburst a special study . Starswirl the Bearded 's study . <p> I always find it funny when someone goes " gasp " in a comic . I picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exposition , this comic touches on Celestia 's feelings immediately after Luna 's banishment . We saw how Celestia performed the deed in Princess Twilight and some of the changes she enacted in Friends Forever #7 and Reflections , though again I 'm not sure how much weight those stories now carry . It 's a question I find fascinating : how did Celestia cope ? The opening hints that she put up some walls between herself and the past , including leaving Starswirl 's study untouched . <p> Hey , Sunburst ? How about some empathy for your princess ! <p> Sunburst 's first exploration takes him to when Celestia and Luna were Starswirl 's pupils and perpetual headaches . We 've seen several takes on Starswirl 's character and appearance . Reflections showed a quirky , somewhat irresponsible magician who could be firm when needed . Fiendship is Magic #3 depicted a more serious Starswirl who doubted the limits of his own power . <p> This comic 's Starswirl is a compromise . He 's much more serious and worldly , but possessing an acid tongue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's future rulers and defenders , one of whom is struggling and the other frustrated . <p> Fleshing out Celestia 's backstory has always been dangerous . Given the image of perfection she often projects , trying to give her flaws has sometimes made her more unappealing than endearing . Yet I like this presentation . Young Celestia knows she is skilled and is frustrated by how Luna 's struggle hinders her own growth . She 's being forced to wait ( a trait that rarely comes easily to the young ) and she takes out her frustration by tormenting Luna . <p> Epic pouty face ! <p> Though Starswirl berates Celestia for her attitude , he 's not coddling Luna either . He 's fixed on the goal of preparing them and makes it clear they ca n't afford to wait for Luna to simply " git gud " . Given that we know the future , it 's easy to see why Luna would harbor an inferiority complex . <p> It all culminates as Luna goes a step too far thanks to Celestia 's goading and opens a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark force , leaving Celestia at her most vulnerable . This is the moment where Celestia experiences a " death " . The proud , brash would-be princess is gone but she 's not yet sure of who she is now . She only knows that her sister is gone and she is scared . <p> Get Twilight ! Wait , curses ! That wo n't work for 1,000 years ! <p> Starswirl continues his trend of firm mentoring as he lays out just how Celestia screwed up before venturing into the dark dimension . It is n't long before they find Luna , who is being forced by the denizens to become Nightmare Moon . <p> Turns out the forces of darkness are really aggressive cosplayers . <p> My criticism here is the same I had for the Nightmare Rarity arc . Nightmare Moon is a cautionary tale against pride and envy . It was a fall engineered by Luna herself . There seems to be this fixation with making Nightmare Moon a mind parasite , or a reincarnation , or the construct of at least two separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than perpetrator . It is true that her pride and envy could leave her vulnerable to an outside force , but even then I think such an idea diminishes the idea behind Luna 's fall . <p> The rescue is swift , but not without some awesome imagery . I was n't too intimidated by the little golems that were forcing Luna into a helm and horse slippers . The deluxe size , however , is a different story . <p> Okay , that 's awesome . <p> Luna and Celestia make their escape with some sisterly bonding to boot . As the tale draws to a close , we learn the real reason that Luna became Nightmare Moon . <p> Not because of dark forces nor her own failings . There is only one true reason the sisters were divided again . <p> Starswirl jinxed it . <p> Way to go , Starswirl the Bearded Jerk ! You jinxed it all ! <p> The timing for this comic is both beneficial and awkward . It was n't meant to come out until Friends Forever completed its run with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets an interesting idea . We get to see how the sisters were originally before we see how they interact in the modern day . So having seen them overcome one obstacle as teens , next we get to see how well or poorly they get along as adults . I 'm looking forward to a compare and contrast . <p> They can laugh now , but I see some discomfort in their expressions . <p> As a first issue of Legends of Magic , this comic offers a taste of the familiar while expanding the scope . I enjoyed seeing this younger , bratty Celestia . It shows that individuals are not born to perfect virtue and they often learn harsh lessons along the way . Celestia has always struck me as a model of experience . <p> Luna 's development is more awkward because I do n't think the fault for Nightmare Moon should lie with anyone except herself . If Celestia is the example of learned maturity , Luna is an example of overcoming one 's own mistakes . <p> Yet I think the positives outweigh any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the series . We 'll see how the comic handles an original character in the next issue .

We 'll see as the conflict with the Changelings reaches the final boss : Queen Chrysalis.Check out the review after the break , but watch out for spoilers in disguise ! We begin with the hero of the Crystal Empire not being in the Crystal Empire . Which is n't really a big deal , but everything else has been leading up to that idea . <p> Still not sure where those Changeling POW 's ended up ... <p> Guardians of Harmony feels a lot like the old mini comics that used to be included with toys . It 's why only a few seem to lead in to one another . As such , it draws attention to almost every chapter that hintedthe Crystal Empire as the final goal . <p> I just ... I ca n't take you seriously like this ! <p> There are possible reasons why . Perhaps the presence of the Wonderbolts caused the Changeling to shift targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe Chrysalis wanted the bulk of Equestria 's forces moving to the Crystal Empire so she could strike at Twilight and company . It 's not inexplicable , but there 's a warning sign when the audience has to come up with an answer . <p> Again , Rarity 's set of priorities is uncompromising ! <p> Whatever the case , we 're back to our core heroines , plus Shining Armor . While the Wonderbolts needed sonic gliders to get from Canterlot to the Crystal Empire , this dude ran the whole way ! I did say I hoped he 'd get to show some prowess . Apparently Shining Armor majored in Track and Field . <p> He really looks malnourished ! Get the dude some Gatorade ! <p> He delivers the potion from Princess Amore 's secret chamber . Given that both chapters feature different artists , the vial 's appearance has changed to a more bulbous design . However , this change also gives us the chance to see one of the best Spike expressions ever . <p> When you ca n't use " WTF " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better suited to Fosgitt 's style . Since the ponies are going to battle in the sky and the ground , there 's greater variety to show characters in action . The battle sequence between Ponyville 's defenders and Chrysalis ' invaders has some great energy with angry red background to increase the tension . <p> We have a violet alicorn down ! <p> That , however , leads us to the featured pony armor . Fans have pointed out that the armor the Mane Six don matches a fan art piece by Equestria Prevails . Like many I would like to know more about how this happened , but for this review I am going to limit the scope to my own thoughts and reactions within the comic 's context . <p> Twilight tests the magical potion and gains sudden knowledge that allows her to upgrade her friends ' defenses . Perhaps a small indignity to Shining Armor . Golden armor is traditionally reserved look for the most elite fantasy heroes , but in Equestria the entire royal guard wears it . Shining Armor unintentionally looks like he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chrysalis has been spotted advancing towards Ponyville . It seems the Changelings really have done away with stealth . But more surprising is her battle cry . <p> " Take no prisoners ? " You 're Changelings ! Prisoners are your thing . A non-prisoner is a non-food source . This adds fuel to my idea that Twilight 's magic armor is a big threat . It makes sense that Chrysalis would want to eliminate both the armor and any knowledge about it . However , this could just as easily be a throw-away line . <p> I 'm not sure this is meant to be a toy promo for the Queen Chrysalis vs Spike 2-pack . Neither is wearing the armor featured . However , Chrysalis already got to wear such an outfit in her Fiendship is Magic issue , which looked pretty awesome . <p> No torso armor piece or hind leg armor for the toy . Not sure why ? <p> Apparently non-armored Chrysalis is stronger than armored Twilight because the Changelings are winning through magical muscle and numbers . Spike , meanwhile , has been sidelined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is reasonable , despite Spike 's bravery in the Crystal Empire . He 's not suited for combat while the ponieseven Fluttershyhave all endured at least one brawl with Changelings . <p> But with nothing to lose , Spike convinces Twilight to use the dragon-marked potion to empower him . And the results are impressive . <p> By the power of Equestria ! I have the POWER ! <p> This is one of the funner things about magic . The rules need n't always be explicit.If there 's consistency then the audience can pick them up . Twilight and company are full-grown ponies , so it makes sense that a dragon-focused spell would only work halfway by bestowing armor . Used to empower an infant dragon , you get both the growth spurt and armor.Yet that leads to a question : why the added steps ? Why not have Spike drink the potion ? At first this seemed odd until I thought on the dragons we 've seen thus far . Even with Ember and Spike as exceptions , dragon 's are n't very altruistic . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from saying " I do what I want ! " and storm off with the prize in tow ? This added step makes the dragon dependent on the caster , offering some degree of control . <p> Out of all the characters featured in this comic , I think Princess Amore comes out on top with the most growth . Not bad for a deposed ruler who is trapped in a limbo state.Of course , there is a third question . What was Amore doing with magic to empower dragons ? I 'll answer that after I figure out what Zecora was doing with an alicorn time-travel memory potion ... So I 'm gon na need a few years . <p> Still better than the 4th season opener 's potion . <p> No , I will not post a screenshot ! <p> This leads to a pretty funny joke as the Changelings try to match Spike dragon-to-dragon . The " that 's cute " look between Big Spike and Shining Armor sells it . However , I am intrigued again by the magical rules . <p> That 's cute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've seen that Chrysalis can impersonate ponies smaller than herself . <p> We 've also seen Luna adopt a guise of her slightly taller , evil side . <p> So , let me pose this idea to you all : could a shape-shifter 's powers vary depending on their own magical level ? Is it possible that a more powerful being , like Chrysalis , could take on shapes much larger than herself ? I 'm seriously picturing a Malificent vibe . <p> Thus the Changeling invasion ... stops . Not " ends " because that implies a resolution . It 's easy to infer that the Wonderbolts saved the Crystal Empire and Celestia and Luna held Canterlot . Yet this seems so abrupt . Much like the mini comics of old , the idea is that the villain has been driven off but could launch a fresh attack tomorrow . <p> So keep those toys handy to go back into battle ! <p> How Good is the Sales Pitch ? Even without her armor , this is Chrysalis ' sole appearance and the fact she 's overpowering Twilight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power scale , Big Spike is able to drive Chrysalis away with a single fire breath . This demonstrates his own power and makes his toy even more appealing . <p> Jay Fosgitt does a better job depicting Big Spike in full armor , though the armor 's details are omitted . As long as the shapes are there I think the target audience will recognize the look better than the sonic gliders . <p> More importantly , Spike 's determination and courage for his friends shows . As is true of the better pitches in this comic , characters make for the best appeals . Spike 's courage is already bigger than buildings .

@@77555700 @6255700/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> ( Since some are freaking out - No , EQD is not shutting down anytime soon and the fandom is n't dying . The fandom is changing with the rest of the internet ) <p> With how crazy this season is looking to be , and how quickly it will end with Canada 's releases , I figured it 's a good a time as any to get this post up . <p> I 'll be honest , EQD does n't really recover from hiatuses . Every time we get a massive gap between new seasons , we shrink for good . We are looking at a hiatus the size of the season 3-4 one with this schedule , which is a tough pill to swallow here . With a smaller EQD , a lot less people are getting noticed . Content creators are having to resort to clickbaity thumbnails and titles , or praying to the Google and Youtube algorithm gods to get noticed . <p> On top of that , news this season is becoming more and more cluttered . In past seasons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trailers , synopsis reveals , and titles spread out throughout a season would keep people coming back . With early episodes , most of those have gone out the window . The massive title and synopsis dumps these last few days means we wo n't have anything to report on news-wise soon , and each of these specific news posts are lost in the flood . This hurts the fandom creation and convention side we post , as people that would usually benefit from an EQD drawing people in to view their stuff on the side after checking out the episode news , wo n't have it either . <p> ( Continued reading below ) <p> We do n't have the robust subscription system or recommendation backbone of Youtube to keep people interested when off season , and with the way the internet is kind of moving at the moment our app is becoming the dominant party on the site .

Many companies are finding that advertising via Google is n't nearly as useful as it used to be , and since EQD is primarily funded on that system , a drop in Google 's dealings means its harder on us . <p> On top of that , adblockers are pretty much the go-to now . It has always been a challenge , but their adoption is much harder on traditional sites . The only way to counter that is more obnoxious ads for people that are n't blocking , or straight up walls for people visiting with blockers .

But heed the tale of the Legend of Spoilers ! Some have gone into this dark land and come out bitter ! <p> That Luna design on one cover is n't the most honest advertising . I think they did it because this version is now more recognizable . <p> Three issues into the series . It 's enjoying a strong start . While Friends Forever had a rough start but eventually found its stride , Legends of Magic seems to know what it wants to be , who it should feature , and what the stories mean . This is helped by the fact that Jeremy Whitely , Brenda Hickey , and Heather Breckel fulfilling the respective roles of writer , artist , and colorist across the opening issues . As a result I think commenting on the art would be repetitive . The same strengths of the first two issues continue here . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps cement the series . <p> Turns out she 's like Pinkie Pie . She 's really commenting on the panel border . <p> I do n't doubt we 'll get alternate artists and writers as the series progresses , but in the moment I 'm enjoying how these three weave Equestria 's history . <p> Dude , talking to yourself is the first sign you need less time alone . <p> Having entertained both Celestia and Luna with tales , Sunburst decides to enjoy a story himself . He supplies the exposition on Mistmane . A mare of stunning looks , she spread beauty all across Equestria . <p> Reminds me of a quote : " The sun setting is no less beautiful than the sun rising . <p> I admit , that first description put me on guard . Speaking as a child of the 80 's , I 've seen a lot of stories where evil things are ugly and good things are beautiful , but looking back as an adult I found the whole thing shallow . The key question is whether or not Mistmane was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be so jelly ! <p> I will say that even after she apparently forefitted her beauty to save a friend and kingdom , Mistmane 's design is still lovely . The way Breckel draws her mane gives me the sense that it flows much like Celestia and Luna 's . Her verdigris green mane and lavender coat compliment one another to create a very cool color scheme . And yes , verdigris is an actual color . Its name comes from a process of exposing copper to the elements , something that Sunburst has to endure . <p> I wonder how he 'd react if he learned about the internet . <p> It might sound lovely to read in a garden , but it has to be just the right spot . Otherwise you ca n't enjoy squat thanks to the bugs , the sunburn , and the humidity . Yes , I 'm more sympathetic to Sunburst here . <p> Did Equestria have ancient labor unions ? <p> But Starswirl 's magical nagging says a lot about his character and this series . The legend of Celestia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already known . Apparently everypony has read about Mistmane 's sacrifice . <p> It was the shot heard around Equestria ! <p> Yet Starswirl insists on respecting these tales and the ponies immortalized . I 'm still not sure if these are stories that Starswirl found , imagined , or documented ; but the central theme is the life behind the legend . Consider that the average history class will outline a person 's events , but understanding what shaped a person beforehand and the consequences that came after is often overlooked . Starswirl wanted to preserve the ponies in their entirety , not just a single event . <p> Sure thing , mysterious stranger ! I trust you 'll be safe in this construction zone without help . <p> In Mistmane 's case , she spent the years after her sacrifice exploring the land . This leads her to discover Canterlot castle 's construction site . The workers complain of setbacks time and again , and so Mistmane volunteers to solve the problem . Why these stallions are so quick to turn things over to a mare they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of talking to ponies that seems to ease their guard . <p> You will not ignore my royal cuteness ! <p> Though she 's in for a challenge as she meets the issue 's guest star : young Princess Luna ! Considering that Luna has featured in each Legends of Magic issue to date , she appears to be a sort of costar to Sunburst . Mistmane , for reasons only she knows , decides to cover her identity as she queries the aggressive princess . My guess is that she did n't want to risk being recognized and distracting Luna as they observe the real culprits . <p> Glad we have a princess of dreams . Because I 'll see that face in my nightmares . <p> In many ways the story 's focus shifts to Luna as she learns why animals would sabotage the construction site . Mistmane is serving as a coach to teach Luna how to watch and listen . It does n't matter that Luna lacks Fluttershy 's animal communication . With a little effort , Luna is able to overcome the trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close . <p> So was Mistmane a beautiful mare ? I would say so . The key thing about her character is that she stops to appreciate the beauty around her . Yet when she approaches ponies she shows her own appeal . She is never condescending or short . She asks a lot of questions , drawing the ponies out of their reserve while learning about the situation . Mistmane never talks about herself , but by expressing a genuine interest in others she forms a bond . That is a beauty that shines brighter than physical looks . <p> Hail to thee , Tibble 's ancestor ! <p> The moral of allowing others to solve their own problems carries great meaning and reflects on Celestia 's teaching style . I ca n't say it 's an absolute , as Mistmane had to relieve the construction crew rather than try to guide them as well . Much like in Friends Forever #3 , there 's a balance between when to help and when to step back . <p> Good thing the worker is a unicorn . An earth pony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> But one question lingers . Starswirl notes that he often thought he saw a hooded unicorn tending the castle gardens . Though Sunburst dismisses this as legend , I 'm wondering if Mistmane is a benevolent spirit . In fact , she might have been a ghost all along . <p> I wish I could react like that when startled . Cursing is boring . Anachronisms are more fun ! <p> She can move around unnoticed and startles ponies when she approaches them . We never see her in need of food , water , or sleep . She can come and go undetected , but seems to share an affinity with animals . I 'm seriously getting a Sixth Sense vibe . <p> I am cuteness ! I am the night ! I am Princess Luna ! <p> Yet the bigger specter hanging over this issue is not a ghost but a question . How does one explain Canterlot Castle and the Castle of the Two Sisters ? This same question came up in the first issue . In both cases it becomes background noise , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to build a castle in the middle of the Everfree forest . <p> I wonder if pegasi worked on the castle 's left side . Would not want to be dangling out over doom otherwise . <p> I always figured that Canterlot Castle was a reaction to Nightmare Moon destroying their old home , but that does n't seem to be the case . So I am a little confused but not so much that the story is undone . <p> Celestia would not have those eyes for any other until she discovered her favorite cake . <p> Continuing the idea of matching these stories to Mane characters , I have two in mind . One might assume Fluttershy , given the animals . Yet I think this story would hold the most appeal for Rarity and Applejack . Rarity for Mistmane 's demonstration of inner beauty and calmness . Applejack for learning the lesson to stop and listen . <p> And for we the audience , I think this is a strong story . I expect there will be complaints that the focus shifted to Luna over Mistmane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mistmane is playing the long game . She 's reinforcing the future rather than trying to the moment 's heroine . So I 'd give this a recommendation and I 'm curious to see what next month holds .

I think a lot of people would roll their eyes because antiquity has an absolute authority . No one person has the right to claim their work is the definitive sequel . Yet the whole point of stories is to convey an idea . If one can recruit a legendary figure to help present this theory , relying on the familiar while presenting something knew , I think it 's worth at least considering . <p> So let 's start off by talking about Rockhoof himself . There are basic design elements that I enjoy . The Nordic-style clothing . His blue coat that contrasts against the background 's earthy tones and greenery . The Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awesome beard . I 'm usually not a fan of pony beards because it seems so odd . I know the ponies already have a pastel-colored coat . Where is this new stuff coming from ? But then again , cartoon logic ! <p> Yet the most intriguing thing about Rockhoof is his cutie mark . The three interlocking triangles ' real name has been lost to time , but modern Norwegians gave the term " Valknut " or " Knot of those fallen in battle . " It might not seem relevant to Rockhoof , but a little more explanation is required . This symbol appears on runestones and memorial stones from the Viking era . It 's often displayed alongside Odin , who was synonymous with the afterlife and leading heroic hordes back into the land of the living . His power heavily influences life and death , and so this symbol is often associated . Very fitting then that it appears as a complex knot . <p> Rockhoof is going to hold sway over life and death in this story . His actions and choices will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might seem apparent . He 's already averted death by saving his village from a lava flow , and has earned his place amongst the Mighty Helm guard . At first it seems great , especially as he 's able to outrace , fight , or generally best any other member . <p> This would later become the rallying cry for over-actors eating the scenery . <p> At first I wondered if this would be like Rainbow Dash joining the Wonderbolts , but this story took the opposite approach . Instead of feeling excluded , Rockhoof is much too popular . Late night parties with weaker members of the Mighty Helm cost him his training regiment . He becomes overweight , slow , and weary . Completely unreliable . To borrow a quote from a certain someone : <p> He 's cuter , but no more intelligible . <p> So when the volcano stirs once more , Rockhoof is paired up with two of the wimpiest guards ponies . It 's a perfect storm of awful as Rockhoof actually makes the situation worse . Thus we 're shown the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same level miracle as he did when he saved his village , but " Happily Ever After " should not translate into lacking future challenges . Failure on this second venture meant retraining and refocusing , finding the drive that earned him that original victory . <p> I look at this image and think of the song " Exile , Vilify " by The National . Du n no why . <p> The acts of slaying threats were necessary , but their path started with the virtues embodied by each character . Courage , empathy , discipline , adaptability , etc . They were fighting for something , rather than proving their own ability to harm . Rockhoof 's own introspection follows this line . He is powerful , but it 's his awareness and judgement that truly makes him a hero . Best of all , he does n't have to end a life to show this . <p> No being , mythical or otherwise , can handle such intensity ! <p> The Cherufe creature is something I 'm hesitant to touch . I did warn about spoilers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the fun and undermine Rockhoof 's presentation . So I 'd like to substitute in the Tri-Horn Bunyip from P.P.O.V. <p> I wan na give it a tummy rub ! Where 's my scuba tank ? <p> I love this creature , not just because it reminds me of a doggy . Mythical creatures are often something to be feared . The term " monster " has its roots in a creature that heralds misfortune . They 're great for embodying our fears but it seems much rarer to find one that symbolizes beauty . Even in Equestria , most mythical creatures view ponies as a meal . The Bunyip was refreshing because its harm was unintentional , and it was much more lovable . <p> Have they invented the term " evacuate " yet ? <p> Though the Cherufe is less approachable , it 's motives and actions are a nice change from the immediate threats of hydras , quarry eels , and that yeti from Yakyakistan . I enjoyed the dilemma this creature represented and how Rockhoof both failed and triumphed in relation . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she see out her right side ? <p> My biggest criticisms for this story relate to the Mighty Helm and the story 's scope . The Helm are mostly disappointing . Except for Captain Steela Oresdotter , the rest are small wimps who are there to look pitiful in order for Rockhoof to look good . It certainly conveys the idea , but it also makes me wonder why Rockhoof would settle for such unreliable companions . <p> I sense a prototypical Canterlot Guard here . <p> The scope has to do with the extremes of Rockhoof 's life . He went too far into indulgence and lost his discipline . When he corrected this , the story implies at the end that he swung too far back the other way . Even Luna protests this seeming downer . <p> Little known fact , Luna would make a fantastic YouTube reviewer . <p> I genuinely think this story could have expanded into a second issue . Perhaps with less physical danger , but that 's the thing about the balance of life and death . Rockhoof saved the village and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is to live . It 's more than the biological fact of still drawing breath . It requires a balance of both discipline and lightheartedness . That 's why I think this story would appeal to Twilight more than other ponies . As one who has often lived by extremes , I thinks she 'd see a lot of herself in Rockhoof . <p> Old Spice . <p> All in all , I think this is a wonderful issue with some great imagery and characters . Perhaps Rockhoof will appear in Starswirl 's books once again or maybe not . Either way , I think Legends of Magic had a strong foray into Equestria 's mythical figures . I 'm hoping the next issues can enjoy similar success.And yes , Rockhoof 's weapon choice does make me think of Shovel Knight . Because I 'm hip with the young people ... Yo . I 'm Silver Quill .

We have the Guardians of Harmony to save the day ! <p> Let 's take a pause from our Muffin Mare 's special day to talk about the annual comic . This year 's choice is a special tie in with the Guardians of Harmony toy line.Check after the break but watch out ! There are no muffins , only spoilers ! <p> Well now , here 's a daunting task . Six stories in this collection . Three artists . Multiple characters . I 'd say that 's a lot to go over and I do n't think a mega-post covering all six stories at once would benefit anyone . So here 's my game plan : today 's post will cover the comic 's general scope and over the next six days we 'll take a closer look at each chapter . That should carry us through to next week , at which point you 'll likely be sick of me.What 's that ? You 're already sick of me ? You cheeky devils ! <p> Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this comic features Andy Price , Tony Fleecs , and Jay Fosgitt . Looking at these three 's past works I 'd say this is a very practical choice . All of them have shown ponies in high energy situations . The perfect choice for a comic based around combat . However , I 'm afraid Fosgitt style can feel like the odd one out . His exaggerated , hyper-cartoon proportions are a stark contrast the Price and Fleec 's more familiar styles . This is not to say the artwork is bad , but the shift is jarring . <p> There is also the concern that some designs appear be taken from fan artworks . More on that when we review the " Big Spike " chapter . <p> Scenes like this could be playing out all across Equestria . <p> Or at a Weird Al concert . Keep him safe ! <p> The sheer scope of this comic demands that each artist put forth a lot of locations . From the halls of Canterlot to the outskirts of the Crystal Empire and Ponyville 's streets , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think each artist does an excellent job of rendering Equestria and the combat taking place between ponies and changelings . The ultimate question is how well each artist depicts the product . <p> Make the kids want it , Twilight ! <p> So let 's get the obvious out of the way : this is a toy sale comic . Each and every story is designed to promote some aspect of the Guardians of Harmony line . I 'd originally written an editor on " Just a Toy Sale " back when I thought the digital release would take place back in November . The main idea I came away with is that a toy sale is not automatically terrible , but the question is how well the introduced elements work with the larger world . <p> Someone please give Andy Price a " Not a Changeling " badge at the next convention ! <p> That larger world is under attack . Forgoing their usual subterfuge , the Changeling have launched a massive attack across Equestria . That 's not to say there is n't guile to their plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponies off . Some are tasked with distracting key figures while other attacks might be designed to lure leaders into vulnerable locations . <p> " Pests " is not the best word choice , given what 's happening outside . <p> Given the ending of season 6 , I 've no doubt some will be turned off to this Changeling invasion . However , I like to think of this as the Changeling 's last hurrah . Unlike the current story arc , this comic is not trying to be a canon lead in to the episodes . I find that just accepting it as an adventure tale makes the experience more fun . <p> Love the framing in this shot . <p> On the pony side , the counter-offensive is much more disorganized . It 's and interesting contrast to see how the Changeling seem to move as a single body , while the ponies are scrambling to figure out the next action . Yet despite the Changeling 's disguise abilities , it 's the ponies ' unpredictability and unique skills that turn the tide . So in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . <p> The last several seasons lead me to believe otherwise , princesses ! <p> Not every pony comes out of this looking great . Except for Twilight , Equestria 's princesses are once again relegated to the sidelines . A disappointing outcome as comics like Nightmare Rarity and Queen Chrysalis ' Fiendship is Magic issue showed that the princesses can lead from the front , which earns greater respect . Then again , Chrysalis herself barely appears in this story , showing none of her usual evil delight.Also , Nightmare Moon is nowhere to be found . Not even a flashback . <p> I 'm going to have a fun time talking about Shining Armor 's depiction . <p> There are , however , elements that expand upon Equestria 's history and mystery . Especially Shining Armor 's trek into the Crystal Empire 's history , and Twilight learning more secrets about her castle . I 'm especially fond of that second idea because up until now it seems the castle 's only role was the map . Seems like a waste of space if the map is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is set outside the show 's canon I ca n't say any of this opens the door to future ideas . Rather , I like that it can serve as an example . These are good ideas to pursue . <p> Humor is still very much a factor . Fluttershy serves as a golden thread between several stories , delivering some very dry humor . Yay for Flutterdry ! We also get returning characters like Sweetie Drops and Lyra Heartstrings , who are not central figures but nevertheless contribute . And Andy Price 's works are never lacking for in-jokes.When KP and I talked about having some irredeemable villains , many fans pointed out that MLP is not a show about beating up the bad guy . If anything , their redemption and acceptance supports Friendship is Magic much better . While I 'd still like to see some more resistant villains , I do understand this point . Thankfully , this comic is not only about combat . Several ponies are motivated by close friendships and the challenge they face is divided loyalties . How to save a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shows that friendship can still be a theme even when the story is more action-oriented . <p> " This relationship . " Every ship needs a refueling ! <p> As a final thought , let 's talk about the sales pitch . Despite some big items like Giant Spike or Cheese Sandwich 's party tank , the real draw here is the characters . As with any good story , this comic makes you want to root for the characters more than own the latest prop . In my eyes this does not diminish the marketability . A prop is good for one ore two stories . A character can be a party of many . I hopeful that Guardians of Harmony will have other chances to tell stories . I enjoy the large conflict with micro-tales all around . There are some questionable choices made by our heroines , but that is story specific.I 'll follow up with you all tomorrow for Rainbow Dash vs the Shadow Bolts .

@@77555737 @6255737/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> I admit , that title loses some street cred when you realize there have only been two non-alicorn princesses in this series . But I 'd say Amore could clean Platinum 's clock ! Yet we 're not here to talk about a princess who long ago went to pieces over her job . We 're here to talk about Shining Armor and how he fared in his chapter for Guardians of Harmony . Check out the review after the break , if you 're brave enough to enter the catacombs of the crystal spoilers ! <p> She royally screwed up at the end , but this comic does a lot for her history . <p> Before diving into this chapter , I want to go over a reason this one stands out to me . My Little Pony is not a show where force wins the day . We 've seen our equine heroines wipe the floor with Changelings or go hoof-to-hoof with Tirek in a magical battle , but in both cases force failed . It was emotional bonds that claimed victory . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character who best expresses the Warrior archetype . Folks who watch my videos likely know I 've taken an interest in these concepts and how they relate to our own development . I imagine some saying , " Silver , you typing trogon , just look at any show or movie aimed at males and you 'll have plenty of warrior examples . " I 'd like to argue that 's incorrect . There 's ample examples of violence in entertainment , but that 's not what makes a Warrior . Guardians of Harmony is a chance to see how these characters handle things in a more physical battle approach , and I think Shining Armor can be an example of an emotionally-healthy warrior . Part of it depends on how he 's drawn . <p> Dead trees ! <p> With Pinkie Pie and Cheese Sandwich 's chapter I said that Tony Fleec 's work was a consistent rhythm . Nothing stood out for good or i 'll , just stable . This chapter is more diverse . The artwork for the Crystal Empire in this chapter is lovely , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renders the Empire . There 's a lot of detail to stress the crystaline nature , including color streaks within the floor and glittering surfaces . Similar to Agnes Garbowska 's style , there is a light texturing to the backgrounds , but the characters are drawn more solid and bold to stand out.This has the tradeoff the the few crystal pegsus guards we see do n't really look like crystal ponies . I wonder how hard that is to render , given that the show itself seems to avoid featuring that effect . I think that 's why , three seasons after the Empire 's introduction , none of the named residents are actual crystal ponies . <p> I do n't think that one guard is saying , " Oh dear ! We 're being pestered ! " <p> Said Crystal Empire is getting a full-on Changeling attack . The very first panel shows the air guards outnumbered 2-to-1 . Unfortunately , they 're on their own as Shining Armor is not allowed to go outside.Yes , his wife has forbidden him to take part in the Empire 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some practicality . Cadance and Celestia agree that without knowing Chrysalis ' location , there 's too much uncertainty about carelessly entering battle . Changelings do operate by subterfuge and a large attack might just be a ploy to capture a member of the royal family . <p> I want to believe she 's going to comfort other ponies . <p> A cynical side of me expects her to go for a hooficure . <p> Yet with there 's an equal consideration . Cadance also states that her magic is protecting the castle from these " pests " . An odd word choice , as the guards and Empire citizens would n't view them as so dismissive . Even if a good number of ponies relocated to the castle , there 's bound to be stragglers . Plus there are definitely guards at risk outside.The confusion grows when I realize that the Empire is probably the best-equipped to handle this invasion . Cadance can control the Crystal Heart , and she and Shining Armor have repulsed a Changeling invasion before . The only reason I can think is that Cadance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she 's setting the situation so that her own subjects are at risk while she keeps her family safe . <p> If anything , sending Shining Armor out might be the best way to expose Chrysalis , and Shining would be willing to do so . It 's clear from the first panel that he 's putting the safety of others first and foremost . That 's the first sign of being a healthy Warrior archetype . His goal is not glory or satisfaction through combat . He wants to remove the threat so others can continue their lives . Cadance says that doing something does n't mean diving in horn-first . I agree , but inaction is not always wisdom . That is the last we see of Cadance . Shining Armor is more proactive . If he ca n't go outside and his wife will not use magic to repel the invasion , actual knowledge might give a third option . <p> I hear that last one has some great visuals <p> but suffers from an unsympathetic protagonist . <p> One plot-convenient book later , Shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weapons cache from Cadance 's predecessor . <p> Okay , that 's is hardcore . <p> This is one of my favorite aspects about this chapter . We only really know Princess Amore from her terrible management of Sombra 's growth back in Fiendship is Magic #1 . This comic offers a glimpse that she was often the Empire 's defender , driving back monsters and creating magical tools . She was smart enough to keep these out of easy reach , guarded by magics and creatures . It seems her greatest failure was being too passive with Sombra 's upbringing . <p> Today on " Cooking with Amore . " <p> I love how Fleecs draws Amore . Though not an alicorn , her form has Celestia 's elegance and a complex design . Less enjoyable is the catacomb 's setting . Much like in Friends Forever #37 , where a violet background swallowed some of Rarity 's look , Shining Armor is now in a blue environment . Though his white coat helps him stand out , the comic shifts to a less diverse palette . Thankfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the darkest depths , often rendered near black . This helps keep him from being swallowed . <p> I wonder how the crystal ponies would feel <p> knowing their home is built atop monster-populated caverns . <p> We never see the magical beasts that guard the depths , but the magic does choose an interesting test . The fact that it chose to impersonate Fluttershy speaks volumes of her timidity . She is so delicate that even ancient magic knows she 's the best one to call on others for help . Shining Armor answers that call , and looks like a panic-stricken fool doing so . <p> Way to keep your composure , Shining ! <p> I 'm not sure what it is about his character that invokes this . Even when Andy Price drew Siege of the Crystal Empire , Shining Armor did n't look all that impressive . This was him realizing that his beloved was in danger : <p> Whoa ! The news scared the fetlocks off him ! <p> I think many people fear the idea of a warrior because it 's often defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end . A Warrior is supposed to be balanced and know when to apply force and when to step aside . That 's why I struggle to find great warrior examples . Often times we 're presented with protagonists who rely so much on violence that their own lives fall out of control . <p> Shining Armor 's moment does not lie in beating up Changelings . Rather , he stands firm to protect Fluttershy when it sounds like an entire swarm is coming towards them . It 's clear from his expression that he knows he 's about to get taken down ... again . Shining Armor is willing to risk himself to save just one pony . This is arguably impractical but it speaks to a personality that cares for others , which invokes greater trust than a cold tactician . <p> However , this scenario is certainly familiar . Many stories have used this setup to show the hero 's nobility and it 's not a huge surprise that a remnant of Amore set up this test . His selflessness has earned Shining Armor entry into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held up well over the centuries . <p> I left behind another enchantment to make sure <p> no one touches my vinyl record collection . <p> Only one vial of unknown magic remains . This is the most cliffhanger close to a chapter within the comic . It leaves the audience wondering and encourage them to turn the page and see what happens next . I would put this chapter as my second-favorite , but for surprising reasons . Shining Armor shows some of the better virtues of a Warrior not through combat , but through action , courage , and selflessness . The comic expands on the oft-neglected Crystal Empire and even gives Amore a better presentation than past comics . <p> Shining is perhaps too trusting . <p> He never once wonders if this might be a Changeling . <p> The only character who comes out the poorer is Cadance , who has a good idea but seems too passive . I think this story could have been enhanced by having Cadance lost in the catacombs and Shining Armor having to follow so they could reactivate the Crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shining Armor rather than Fluttershy . Although , this chapter cements Fluttershy as the most reoccurring character in the comic . How Good is the Sales Pitch ? This is an interesting question because look at how Shining Armor is presented . He never goes on the attack . Never fires a magical beam . Never even dons the captain of the guard armor seen on his toy . This comic is all about him as a character and why he 's not defined by violence . It 's a mixed presentation but it 's far more than his original introduction as a set piece alongside Cadance . <p> I do n't think that would make most folks want to rush out and buy this figure , but I do appreciate that this is showing Shining Armor 's best traits that can serve him in battle and as a husband , father , brother , and hopefully leader . Good characters do make for better toy sales , so this is not a criticism but a surprise . <p> " And I 'm sure your wife shows the same care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , cripes . She 's a stay-in-the-tower princess , is n't she ? " <p> Some of Shining 's expressions and poses in this chapter do n't convey confidence . He seems more clumsy and less sure of himself . It 's not a requirement that Warrior be perfect in motion and form all the time , but I still hope Shining Armor can show his best prowess down the line . <p> It 's also funny to realize that the most violent image in this chapter is courtesy of a long-gone princess . Tomorrow we shall talk about how Equestria 's most proactive princess carried the day . Stay tuned for Shining Armor 's sister and unexpected guest stars ! I 'm Silver Quill . Thanks for reading ! 
@@77555738 @6255738/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> The most recent 3-party story has drawn to a close . Time now to look at this arc start to finish and see how it all fits together . <p> Spoilers ahead with no memory-wipes available . Well , I guess you could clear your browser 's history , but that 's not your memory . <p> If you 'd like to read the individual issue reviews , please click on the respective comic cover . <p> From the Shadows had a lot of challenges even before the first page . I think many fans were wary after the previous 3-part arc , Chaos Theory . Add to that a promise from Hasbro and IDW that the comics line would now tie into the show 's storyline , and it 's a significant challenge . <p> Shadow Lock does n't realize how close <p> he came to meeting his end that day . <p> My experience with franchises like Halo , . HACK and Gears of War have made me wary of cross-media storylines . If the only way to get a complete story is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been given a homework assignment rather than an entertainment piece . <p> Relax , Spike . You 're a way better dragon than he . <p> Because of this I 'm going to approach From the Shadows as a stand-alone story . If the events of this comic become more clear in the show , I 'll be happy to do a retrospective piece seeing how they tie together . For if a comic can enhance the show 's storyline without becoming required reading , then I think it 's a good balance . <p> Let 's take a look at some of the bigger themes . <p> Fear the Shadows The biggest theme is the fear of the unknown . It beings with something simple : a scary play . The Mane Six and Spike get to talk about how it feels to be afraid of what 's before them , but not knowing what comes next is even worse . <p> Twilight 's mane . Second only to Marge Simpson 's hair in power . <p> After Shadow Lock makes his first move , Twilight becomes fearful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chase begins and Shadow Lock 's actions become even more desperate . Twilight notes in issue #52 that Shadow Lock is extremely reckless and making sloppy mistakes . <p> Just ship already ! <p> Thus we learn Shadow Lock 's motivation : to wipe the memory of his evil ancestor from existence and therefore safeguard Equestria . The immediate contradiction is that erasing the knowledge does n't make anyone safer . As Twilight rightly argues , removing the memory of this ancient threat also removes the memory of how it was defeated . <p> I can tell this plan is working well for you . <p> The greater contradiction is something I realized during my re-read of the series . Twilight is right to say that Shadow Lock is being reckless and clumsy , because he 's growing more afraid . Shadow Lock 's spell wipes both a book 's contents and the memory of that information from a reader 's mind . That 's why he can expect a lawsuit from the Ponyville school board and the CMC 's families . <p> I said this story was stand-alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . : ) <p> What Shadow Lock reveals is that this spell influences him as well . Though he can remember the name of his ancestor , he ca n't remember the details . So the more he pursues his quest , the more nebulous the threat . Tying that idea back to the first part , he 's actually becoming more afraid and it 's shown by his escalation . On his first encounter with Twilight , his sole tactic is to create a barrier of books and escape . So why then does he not do the same when the Mane Six confront him in a town library ? Instead , he increases the threat by unleashing fictional monsters . Finally he places Twilight 's friends in worlds where they can be hurt with no immediate escape . <p> Really wondering why they dismissed the museum guards . <p> Going from quick escape to direct threat , Shadow Lock 's own quest is driving him further to the edge . It all comes back to fear of the unknown that he is unintentionally feeding . <p> Honoring History @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Messing with books ? Kind of her thing . Wiping away knowledge ? Prepare for a beat-down . Endangering her friends ? What would you like on your tombstone ? <p> Dang , that dude is tall ! <p> In truth , Twilight shows remarkable restraint throughout this story . Her goal is never to punish Shadow Lock but she tries repeatedly to talk him down . This is where this arc surpasses Chaos Theory . Twilight verbally engages Shadow Lock in every issue , so when he finally does stop and listen it feels much less abrupt than when Accord heeded Starlight . <p> Seriously , just ship ! <p> Though to Chaos Theory 's credit I do think that Starlight argued for diversity just as well as Twilight argued for history here . Rather than viewing it as dates and long-gone figures , Twilight weaves a portrayal of stories that can inspire modern people . History is a study of action and consequence , offering both caution and hope even when situations or people 's mistakes invite despair . <p> As much as I appreciate her message , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " run away ! " <p> Twilight actually restores some of Shadow Lock 's hope when she convinces him that history can save the future . It 's nice to enjoy a story where victory does n't go to the character with the greatest weapon or the most violence . I enjoy a good fight scene , but one reason My Little Pony stand out is that the characters can still adventure without having to hurt someone to show their best . This goes for Twilight 's friends as well . <p> There are days I wish I could muster half the enthusiasm of Twilight Sparkle . <p> Mane Six Misadventures Reading all three parts , a pattern quickly emerges . The Mane Six and Spike visit a new locale , pair off , and get into mini-adventures . Tony Fleecs does wonderful job rendering a variety of locations and ponies . Though an Egyptian treasure room is more visually interesting than a cave , I never get the impression that an area is being dismissed or developed with the bare minimum . Another way this story surpasses Chaos Theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to confront Shadow Lock the same way as Twilight , yet their own challenges keep the tension level high . We can enjoy Twilight and Shadow Lock 's verbal sparing because it has a contrasting partner with Applejack battling Frankenstag 's monster , or Rarity and Rainbow Dash fighting a mummy . Or Pinkie Pie doing ... this ... <p> This comic has made me wonder about Pinkie 's insanity level . I think it 's at a 10 . <p> I can point to at least one part where each character has a chance to shine . Applejack 's hoof-wrestling a buffalo adds some humor to Fluttershy 's charm winning a match . Rarity and Rainbow face down Anubis guards and a irritated queen with a combined knowledge of fashion and Daring Do abilities . Spike is at his best helping knights who were set to attack him , and Pinkie Pie ... Well , see above . <p> I 'm still not sure if there was any meaning behind Pinkie Pie 's dream . <p> There is , however , a interesting commentary on pony viewpoints . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often lower their guard , never assuming that Shadow Lock might try to cause them direct harm . Given the ponies ' eagerness to forgive , I find it a display of both their strengths and weaknesses . Quick to forgive , but too naive to be safe . <p> Shadow Lock and Great-Great-Great-Grand Papa Looking over this series also caused me to amend my opinion on Shadow Lock 's appearance . When he first appeared , I compared him to Written Script , a background stallion . He was mostly a collection of physical traits wrapped in a cloak . Over the story 's arc , Shadow Lock became less about physical quirks like his cape and scar and more about how tired he looked . The scared , uncertain pony began to show through . He 's not as fanatical as previous villains and so he can be reasoned with if one can get him to stand still . <p> This was my attitude towards school book reports . <p> Yet it was n't until the final chapter that I got a proper height reference . For two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but seeing him stand next to alicorn Twilight I realized that his body is more comparable to Shining Armor 's . So the fact that a big , magically powerful stallion like Shadow Lock is afraid of something should be a testament to the danger itself . Yet strangely I do n't feel a strong sense of dread , even with the mystery ancestor 's revelation . <p> Think that 's scary ? Imagine asking that guy to pose for a drawing . <p> The image shown in a long-forgotten book shows something that resembles a Changeling 's design but with some stronger equine features . The wings are sprouting from the chest , making me think this being is either wearing armor or the wings themselves are magical constructs . One thing that Shadow Lock was n't clear about is whether he feared his ancestor 's actual return , or if he fears the darkness that once empowered this danger . The shadows surrounding the page seem to suggest the latter . This power might actually come after Shadow Lock , forcing the Mane Six to stop a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I 'd like to know more about this pony beyond his fear . <p> The odd thing about this threat is that it 's very academic . All evidence of its evil is contained in books that are mostly erased . So all we really have to go on is the vague fear that the unknown invokes . I 'm a fan of demonstrating evil by seeing its mark on the world . A barren wasteland where the villain once traversed . A shattered fortress they attacked . Something that stands as an unintentional monument to the threat . Although this new enemy looks imposing , I ca n't yet view it as something worse than what the Mane Six have already defeated . Shadow Lock is likely right to fear it , but he has n't faced as many challenges as Twilight and company . <p> The Bottom Line There 's a lot more I could talk about . A wealth of pop culture references . Recurring humor and Pinkie 's strange clairvoyance about mummies . Really great character designs . Yet I 'm already grateful you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting itself up to be a prelude to a greater threat , but I do think it stands on its own . Shadow Lock is not a deep character , but he is a lot more interesting that other antagonists . The story has a lot of fun mini-battles and exploration of new areas . While this story does n't have the same climactic end like other storiesThe Return of Queen Chrysalis being a good exampleit does hold the reader 's interest from start to finish . <p> I do n't think I 've ever heard a good person call out " Guards ! " <p> This is a comic story I needed to read after a long period of a-typical stories . We 've seen the Mane Six act as villains . We 've seen the princesses struggle and fail . We 've seen villains struggle with their own past and redeem one another . What we have n't seen in a while is the Mane Six getting to be themselves .

@@77555746 @6255746/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> A rather violent suggestion , I admit . But we 're about to talk about a pony of action ! Let 's have a look at Rainbow Dash 's chapter in Guardians of Harmony.Click for more but beware a right-hook from spoilers ! I think it 'd be a mistake to call this the start of Guardians of Harmony . It is the first chapter in the comic but I do n't view these as a strictly linear set . There is a flow to the events but some are concurrent and so this is but one event happening alongside several others.Reading these , I do think back to old comics like He-Man and Wheeled Warriors , which featured introductory comics . <p> Rainbow Dash hardly needs any introduction but this is story has a veryself-contained feel to it , despite the attempted cliffhanger.As I write " this chapter is drawn by Andy Price " I feel like I 've already given my opinion . My favorite comic artist and , as of this collection , possible Changeling . It 's not just the way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the size of the pegasi 's wings . Yet it 's how he arranges the panels that impresses me . Every panel leads the eye to a focal point or indications the action 's direction . Price is a personal guide through the story , pointing out moments of interest just by setting each piece just so . My favorite panel in this chapter is a prime example : <p> Everything about this panel works . It divides the visuals into three setsand keeps the focus on the central diamond . <p> At first I was going to say that this chapter was light on his usual visual references , but I would be wrong . There is a double-reference to both a famous detective and a certain Disney movie all rolled into one panel . I do n't want to give it away so I will challenge the sharp-eyed to give the comic a read and spot it.The humor in this chapter mostly comes from Fluttershy . She 's thrilled to have a moment of tranquility with her oldest friend , when Applejack comes knocking with a warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wishes those villains would stay off her lawn ! <p> It 's Fluttershy 's fatigue that sells the humor . A " this is my life now " attitude . What to call this ? Fatigushy ? Flutteresigned ? Does n't quite roll off the tongue ... but I digress . <p> See you in a couple chapters , ' Shy ! <p> Rainbow 's at the other end of the spectrum , thrilled to have a new crisis where she and the Wonderbolts can shine . So she 's off and away until ambushed by two mystery figures . Again , Price shows his skill at creating some frightening images . <p> This is actually Rainbow 's attempt at an Owlicious impersonation . <p> I said that Nightmare Moon did n't appear in this comic , but does a reference count ? I 'm going to say " no " , but she is at least referenced . The Shadow Bolts return and are not just hallucinations . Rainbow Dash is suddenly placed in the same quandary Discord presented in The Return of Harmony Part 1 . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as well . <p> I was n't sure of what went through Rianbow 's head back when Discord messed with her , but it 's nice to see her choose to protect her home . She is setting aside the chance for glory for the sake of others . " Those with the greatest power ... protect those without " as Charles Xavier might say.She does make a passing comment about being the Element of Loyalty , but that did n't do her much good the last time . This is a choice that speaks to her character rather than any power . <p> " Come do the dark side . We have cake . " <p> " So does Pinkie Pie ! " <p> " Oh ... shoot . I got nothing . " <p> It 's here that I come back to my violent question . Why not deck these two and have done ? Well , the Shadow Bolts do know what to say to get Rainbow 's ego back in play . Her choice was for others , but how she handles the problem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special treat that gives you that glint . <p> Ele-mints . <p> The action is well drawn and feels like the race that originally caused filly Rainbow to cast that fateful sonic rainboom . So I think it better just to cut to the chase : they 're Changelings . In fact , seeing her whoop these two reminds me that Rainbow 's got a thing for combating Changelings . I hope Thorax never learns about her dreams . <p> Turns out that 's Thorax 's cousin , Roger . <p> But here 's the thing about the Changelings : this was very smart . The goal was to delay Rainbow long enough to keep her from the Wonderbolts and diminish the counter-offensive . They did so by appealing to her ego and using figures from her past . The fact they even knew about the Shadow Bolts suggests that they 've done their homework.For a while now , fans have debated if Chrysalis ' poor impersonation of Cadance was intentional . That she was trying to force that confrontation with Twilight . After To Where and Back Again I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful at impersonations . Yet this comic shows them knowing their target and playing some mind games . It 's one of the best Changeling plays to date . <p> There are some contradictions . Rainbow departs saying she 's got to get to Canterlot fast , but when we next see her she 's doubled back to Ponyville . The Changelings also suggest that Chrysalis is at the Crystal Empire , but we 'll see her attack Ponyville . <p> It 's possible that the Changelings were lying as another form of misdirection , and perhaps Rainbow wised up and realized that there might be more than just those two nearby . This is purely speculation so another answer might just be a plot hole . For now I want to focus on the key question for every chapter.How Good is the Sales Pitch ? Let 's just tackle this head-on . The goal here is to advertise the Rainbow Dash figure and the Shadow Bolt figure . How does that go in terms of making them a part of the world ? <p> Well , Rainbow Dash requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most action-oriented of the team in a toy line centered around action and adventure ? Add in that she comes bundled with Tank ( briefly featured in this comic ) and it 's an easy win.I ca n't say the same for the Shadow Bolt . Despite multiple references across both My Little Pony and Equestria Girls , the actual Shadow Bolts are still illusions . They are single-event pieces that appear and then disappear back into nothingness . That 's a harder sell for a toy . Oddly , the cockatrice that comes with the Shadow Bolt is a more lasting feature to Equestria . <p> I 'm still holding out for Lightning Dust and Wind Rider to create a rival team . Best hope ! <p> If ranking the stories within Guardians of Harmony I would put this chapter at #3 . It 's a fun tale with some nice moments for Rainbow , though it does n't really hit us with anything unexpected.Come back tomorrow as we talk about Pinkie Pie and Cheese Sandwich 's adventure .

Be sure you 've read the comic before reading ! <p> Let 's be straightforward : this is my favorite comic . Of all the issues IDW has produced , this one remains the funnest read and the one I 'd recommend to newcomers . How has it stood the test of time ? Normally I like to go through the story linearly and dissect what works . Yet there are so many components that I fear I 'd lose most of you halfway . Much like the episode Slice of Life , this two-parter invites us to shift focus between unrelated parties . Some are easy to track as they have very prominent roles . Other storylines can be as brief as one panel.Instead of drowning in details , let 's tackle the big picture.Art GaloreAndy Price cemented himself as my comic favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range far and wide . The normally stoic Big McIntosh enjoys several memorable looks . <p> The greatest compliment , however , is how Price sets up the panels . Often times the panels will visually flow one into another or overlap in ways that create a hierarchy for the reader . I 'm never lost while reading because the comic guides my eye through a crafted layout . Even a simple background of shapes can convey the characters ' thoughts . <p> Fleetfoot , you might want to get that checked . <p> We get a ton of returning characters from outside Ponyville , though many are background elements . Add in plenty of new looking ponies and a ton of small references and you have a comic that will keep you visually entertained for at least 4-5 reads . <p> Wait ! Self-insert OC ! 0/10 . Worst ever .

Even Princess Luna gets involved and drags him into the town 's games.Luna 's a particular interest as this follows up her transformation in the Nightmare Rarity arc . No longer plagued with doubt , she 's become more hyperactive and playful . It 's the sillier aspects of her Luna Eclipsed persona times ten . This would be Luna 's default for many future comics , for good or i 'll . In the moment , however , she 's just fun . <p> Blame your sister ? For that awesome shirt ? <p> No can do ! <p> Folks who did n't enjoy Slice of Life might find this a better alternative because Big McIntosh serves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because he 's so quiet and reserved , he plays the spectator to surrounding events . He 's the crimson thread weaving several disconnected events together . We as the readers walk beside him , witnessing the town 's quirks.The town itself becomes a character . Many times Ponyville has served as witness or victim to the Mane Six 's adventures . Now we see the town ponies celebrating , arguing , detonating , dancing , and overall being themselves . It 's one of the best things about the comics ' potential . Many fans debate whether or not they 're canon within the larger franchise , but no one really objects when the comics flesh out smaller parts of Equestria .

I 've said before that Katie Cook has made Equestria 's unknown her playground . What 's more unknown than Big Mac 's inner workings ? What we see in a guy who is focused to the point of obliviousness . He 's a character who enjoys the beautiful peace of the farm and avoid the hustle of crowds . Even after reconsidering his journey , Big Mac enjoys the festival on his own . He 's far from anti-social but seems to prefer some distance . That only makes the advances of several mares all the more interesting . <p> A lot of Big McIntosh 's appeal in the show has been undermining male stereotypes . He likes to have a doll . He dreams of being princess of apples . These moments are fun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comedic relief . This comic treats him as a true character and is all the stronger.All that said , fans who favor adventure-based stories might share in Big Mac 's frustration . This is low-stakes , high comedy storytelling . There 's no real sense of risk and the biggest we get to nefarious ends is Spike 's business hustling . If the humor does n't carry the piece then it will fall through . Give it a read and see if the town 's celebration takes hold .

They made choices and faced consequences , showing both vulnerability and strength . As a result these powers felt earned and more satisfying . Other magical events like the royal couple 's shockwave or the crystal heart 's power felt more shallow because we did n't witness as much of a journey . Often the focus was narrowed to a few characters , leaving key characters out of the loop.This time Twilight is getting a new set of armor almost for free . The only barrier is that the door wo n't open unless two friends are present who have faced the most difficult of tests . I 'm going to chalk this up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter 's past and affirming their friendship is real . A mean-spirited Changeling doens't strike me as the " greatest of tests " . One harp throw and the friendship is back in business . <p> Twilight , should n't you get other ponies to the castle as well ? <p> Going back to the armor , there is an function I enjoy . Not the clamping capture wings , but rather how it 's used . With the previous powers listed , the energy flash solved all the problems . The villain was weakened or converted , the imprisoned liberated , the infirm strengthened , and all Equestria 's ills reset to zero . In a sense , the magical charges did the fighting for the Mane Six . This armor has magical power to allow Twilight to see through deception , but it still relies on her own flight ability and dedication to seek out the Changelings . <p> There 's a smaller line of mystery text . <p> " If you can read this , you do n't need glasses . " <p> I also recognize this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tales as well . My favorite example is The Soldier and Death , which featured a man receiving powerful tools in exchange for generosity and self-sacrifice . Twilight is working to save other ponies , so some help from a magical resource makes sense.I 'm also glad that the castle 's mystery expands , because I shall never celebrate its interior . Colorist Heather Breckel and Andy Price do some nice things to make this place work , but I just do n't like the interior . The cold hues of violet and icy blue make it seem so unwelcoming . It 's anything but a home . Fortunately , Breackel uses the blue floor and gradients along the walls , combined with golden banisters , to help Twilight stand out against the background . Price likewise draws in details to at least try and make this castle more homely , including portraits of Celestia and others . <p> Mad props to Andy Price for setting his own ponysona as a Changeling . I do n't know if we 're seeing things as Twilight views them , but given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armor is forcing the Changeling to reveal itself . <p> Again , I want to give Andy Price a <p> " Not a Changeling " badge at Babscon . <p> Twilight states that this will clear up the Changeling invasion within Ponyville , and after that it 's off to the Crystal Empire . This will not happen . It 's possible that word of her success reached Chrysalis , who would want to eliminate a set of armor that could remove the Changeling 's greatest power . <p> Why does n't the Changeling jump out ? <p> Because that thing comes equipped with a seatbelt . <p> I 'm left to wonder where Twilight is depositing those Changeling 's as well as how this armor might impact future Changeling-pony relations . <p> How Good is the Sales Pitch ? The armor is only employed for two panels and never features a sharp " snap " but rather a " snag " . Spike is Twilight 's spear-bearer but I take this to be ceremonial . I like seeing the ponies take a direct approach , but impalement is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter is that Twilight has been given a new , powerful tool that she can use against multiple threats.Though personally I bought the two-pack just for Twilight 's war-face.I think this is an effective pitch but the real appeal lies in the armor 's origin . Did the castle willfully create it or was it crafted by another and the castle acted as a conduit . A little mystery gets young minds going and can set up an idea for some play time . I 'm fine with having some lingering questions . <p> This is my favorite chapter of the bunch . It features two supporting ponies who may be comic relief , but their own friendship has an impact . It 's nice when Equestria 's scope expands to feature more than just the Mane Six 's adventures . Twilight remains determined but practical , and her home may have a will of its own or someone else could be looking out for her . We may never get answers but that also gives room for fan ideas to come forth . Tomorrow we 'll see how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quill . Thanks for reading !

The project is back on track , but they are looking for writers , sketchers , background artists , and an assistant coder to really get the ball rolling faster than planned . <p> Head on down below the break for information on it if you are interested ! <p> The Gentlecolts group is creating an MLP romance visual novel/dating simulator . We were dead for quite a while before reviving the project in January of this year , getting a HUGE response , over 100 people joined our discord ( discord.gg/KFZRgew ) and we can finally announce that we have a team and can start working on the game ! We 're officially back in business ! The team is quite small however , and we would REALLY like more members so that it wo n't take years to complete the game . Are you interested ? Would you like to help us ? Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Writers : We need writers able to write in proper English , with good grammar , little to no misused words , missing , incorrect or overused punctuation , able to follow a format , that has some skill in dialogue , and that would like to work on the genre of the game , slice of life , romance , and probably comedy . Someone who can come up with storylines and convincing social and romantic situations involving the Main characters in the show . We do n't need dark and gritty writers , or people who write huge adventures and such , ' cause it 's out of the scope of the game . Artists : Sketchers : Skilled most importantly in expressions and a bit in poses , as several times they 'll need to do floating heads , just showing a different expression . Does n't matter what you do the sketches on , and they do n't need impressive detail , but also ca n't be stick figures .

Vector Artists : They need to be able to make their vectors look as show-accurate as possible , and when translating the sketch , they do n't have to follow the sketch to a T , but make it as truthful to the show as possible , fixing any errors , detail or style related issues in the sketch . There 'll be certain guidelines to follow with all the artists to have a more consistent style and make it as less distinguishable as possible between the different artists in play , and all vectors must be presented in SVG files . Background Artists : Again , we need vector artists that can be show-accurate , but in this case , most backgrounds will be the same as the show , and will most likely not need to use sketches and instead , have references and bases from show screenshots and such to draw . Most likely will have to do some of the Mane 6 's houses inside and outside , as well as some key-points of Ponyville and not much else . <p> Others : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preferably familiar with Ren'Py ( or competent enough to get the gist fast ) , to help with various tasks . Proofreaders and Spellcheckers : We might also have use of people good at spotting aforementioned errors that can happen in writing , to help ease the burden and not require multiple checks by every writer . We would much prefer competent writers , but if you just want to help a little bit this could be an option . We could also fill in other roles such as sound or PR ... just drop by our discord and say hello , we can figure out what you can help us with !

Well , Spitfire is locked into some sort of contraption , with wings . While that kids arm is probably the toys equivalent to the Dizzatron , this toys strange profile may make it more of a spring powered launcher . Its an interesting idea and could be something else altogether , but a launcher would let us fly to the castle a bit easier . <p> 3 <p> Spike is Not Packaged with Shining Armor but with Himself <p> So it was a bit misleading in their ads but hey , Hasbro does n't want you buying just one toy .

With that in mind , if you look at packaging these two toys clearly state " Fan Series " under their " Guardians of Harmony " logo . <p> So what does that mean for us ? Hasbro made a pretty big point in their latest webinar that Friendship is Magic has fans outside the definition of little girl , and stated they wanted to embrace all the people with money ( or their parents money ) they can . So not only does this mean cool toys for Timmy to play with too , along with his sister , it also means more merch aimed at bronies and collectors .

@@77555811 @6255811/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> The Wonderbolts have n't had the best run over the franchise 's history . Maybe they can turn it around by saving a whole Empire from Changelings . <p> Of course , they 've got to get there first . Let 's see what they do in this chapter of Guardians of Harmony . <p> Read the review after the break but watch out for super-sonic spoilers ! <p> That dude on the left ? His name is Wave Chill . <p> I meant what I said about the Wonderbolts not faring well . Across the whole series they 've lost to a flailing fashionista , a hoarding dragon , Tirek , and even their own egos . So this might be a hard sell as they 're tasked with reinforcing the Crystal Empire . The final two chapters of Guardians of Harmony are drawn by Jay Fosgitt . I 've said in the past that Fosgitt 's style often features a lot of energy , but that was usually on the ground . Lots of running and jumping by the ponies . A comic featuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's going to be a challenge . <p> GASP ! Could Spitfire be a Big MacIntosh fan ? <p> I can think of two ways to convey flight in a still image . The first is to keep the subject looking still but blur everything else to convey a zooming perspective . The second way is what Fosgitt employs . Speed lines and a sort of motion trail to mark the flight path . Fosgitt 's style is good for energy , but the hyper-cartoon proportions might work against this . If Guardians of Harmony is supposed to be an action adventure then having the ponies appear cuter can undermine the feel . We start out with Spitfire and Soarin ' reporting to Princess Celestia . They 've been tasked with rescuing the Crystal Empire because Cadance still has n't lit the heart . It does make sense that if Celestia instructed Cadance to sit tight , the princess of the sun should be responsible for sending reinforcements . Does n't invalidate any criticism against Cadance but this makes much more sense than their plans against Tirek . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but whatevs . <p> Celestia and Luna assert that they can keep an eye on things in Canterlot . Their expressions might be an attempt at composure , but they tend to look rather bored . I 've joked about Luna 's line that they can hold the fort , but that in itself is a sad commentary . We 've gotten too used to the idea of Celestia and Luna being defeated , captured , or indisposed . It 's happened so much that it 's become the default . That 's the main reason I 'm sorry these two do n't enjoy their own chapter . With most of their forces directed towards protecting Ponyville and saving the Crystal Empire , a confrontation with Chrysalis would be a welcome story . As it is , we only see them for two panels before Spitfire and Soarin ' zoom away . Soarin ' appears to be the more practical one as he lists the significant distance between Canterlot and the Empire . Those who have seen the map of Equestria know that this chapter is n't factually accurate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the Empire . Yet the point remains that it 's too far a distance for them to make any difference . Spitfire is more reserved , only agreeing before instructing him to gather the others . <p> I want to touch back on the idea of an emotionally-healthy Warrior . A lot of stories like The Hurt Locker talk about the idea that war is a drug and that those who have been in combat struggle with life outside the battlefield . However , the ideal of the Warrior is someone who understands balance between both phases . We see a glimpse of this as the various Wonderbolts answer the call . <p> Get it ? She plays soccer because she 's FleetFOOT ! <p> Each one is engaging in some sort of peaceful activity , though I 'm betting Firestreak got stuck with some kind of punishment . I do n't know many folks who would enjoy cleaning out a weather exhaust port in their free time . Yet each one does n't hesitate to drop what their doing and gather to defend their home . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... um ... I got nothing . <p> Soarin ' rounds them up in short order so Spitfire can deliver the plan . They 're to ride on prototype sonic gliders that will allow them to match rainboom speeds . I 'm not very engineer minded but as I understand it , most gliders do not have engines . So right off the bat these things are a contradiction , and we 've not yet gotten to the most awkward part of this comic : the gliders ' design . <p> The Jetsons called . They want their scooters back ! <p> Fosgitt has a unique style and I often appreciate that shift from the norm . In this case , however , different works against the idea . If the goal of this comic is to promote the toy then these strange gliders look nothing like the wing pack advertised . If one reads this comic with no care for the toys , then the gliders do n't make much sense . There is nothing securing the Wonderbolts to the gliders and they are n't visually impressive . Plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wonderbolts are perfectly still then there 's not much energy to convey , though that stands in contrast to the next panel . <p> Ponies , close your mouths ! Gon na get bugs in your teeth ! <p> The real head-scratcher is that the gliders look so different , but Fosgitt got the Wonderbolts exactly right . That 's no small feat . Even as I write this I 'm looking up each member on the MLP Wiki to try and keep it all straight . So I do n't understand how this change came about . This is one of those times I 'd like to know the story behind the story.The gliders do the job and the Wonderbolts show they have some combat skills when facing the Changelings . We leave the battle midway as Spitfire hopes that someone else has a plan to end the attack . It seems the Wonderbolts know they are only a stopgap measure . <p> How Good is the Sales Pitch ? That 's an awkward question . In terms of characters we get a little bit of building for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical and acts as second-in-command . He knows the logistics , which leaves Spitfire free to innovate . Although she 's very serious and focused , her comment that riding these potentially-explosive gliders as " This is gon na be fun " shows a reckless side . Characters mean more than props in a good pitch so I 'd say this part of the comic is successful . <p> The wing pack turned glider is another story . It does n't look very impressive and the mechanics do n't make much sense . Granted , the actual wing pack is several rockets and a set of wings that would like shove one 's legs through their stomach , but at least it conveys some power . I think it 's better that the actual toy surpasses the comic rather than the inverse . As a child of the 80 's , I know that disappointment all too well . <p> SURPRISE ! There 's no real surprise . <p> A very mixed pitch , but I do appreciate how it expands the Wonderbolts . When this fight is over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish his janitorial duty . Misty Fly can finish that nap , High Winds will keep cloud busting , and Surprise will conclude her shopping . The Wonderbolts will know that the fight is done and focus on other things . That 's the greatest difference between them and the attacking Changelings.Tomorrow we 'll wrap this up by talking about Spike 's growth spurt . Until then .

@@77555833 @6255833/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> Project SEAPonyCon is coming and to make life easier for those going to a con for the first time or thinking about doing so they have come up with a neat guide covering six important elements of convention going . <p> Check on after the break for the full guide ! <p> " The six elements of attending a convention " <p> An editorial by Project SEAPonyCon <p> Time flew by really quickly ! It seems like it was just yesterday when we revealed Project SEAPonyCon to the world , now were just six months away from the Southeast Asias most anticipated pony convention . If you have not done so yet , it 's not too late to plan your journey to Bangkok ! <p> Project SEAPonyCon is n't just for Southeast Asia - it 's a convention by Southeast Asia for everyone and all are welcome . The convention will be held in English and features some of the best projects from the fandom born and bred in this part of the world . <p> Before we get into it , remember that attending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisers all over the world go to great lengths to make these events happen but even then we ca n't please everyone . <p> Many times we hear bronies complain and groan about the lack of a pony convention in their neighborhood . Going for a convention requires a conscious effort and no one can make that effort but yourself . <p> Remember that pony conventions are n't like the Olympics . There is no grand central committee deciding which cities get to hold conventions and no one is battling for any rank or honour to hold one . They come about as the result of diligent and committed individuals putting their hearts and minds together to create something beautiful . All that 's left for you to do is to enjoy the party . <p> Let 's break down what you need to attend a convention ! Here we have six main things to consider - Airfare , Transport , Lodging , Food , Admission and Spending . <p> Face it , travelling by air is n't cheap but sometimes its the only way to get to your destination . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the safest modes of transport and with the emergence of low cost carriers all around the world , the price of an air ticket has been reduced drastically . <p> At the time of writing , many flights to Bangkok from around Southeast Asia hover around 150 USD ( US Dollars ) on average . Some flights from places like Changi , Singapore and Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia are going for as low as 70 USD . Its still a good time to lock-in your booking so do n't  hesitate . You may miss out on these prices if you do ! <p> Bear in mind , however , that most budget airlines do not include check-in luggage in the base ticket fare . If you are considering shopping at the convention , you may need to either purchase a checked bag as an add-on to your flight ticket or choose an airline ticket that includes a checked bag . Do this in advance as it is often cheaper to pre-book a checked bag as opposed to doing it at the airport . Take note of weight limits as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airline . <p> For Project SEAPonyCon , low-cost carriers typically land at the Don Mueang International Airport in Bangkok . From there , buses are available to take you to the city centre . <p> If you are travelling internationally , ensure your passport is valid for at least six months from the departure date of your flight - this is a MUST by international standards . Be sure to check about immigration requirements and which countries your passport is valid to travel to . You may also need to apply for an entry permit or a visa so do this early - you do n't  want to be caught without the right paperwork ! <p> Getting to the city is half the deal - the other is getting to exactly where you need to be - be it your accommodation or the convention centre . <p> Unless you are travelling in a group , renting a car is not a viable option - at least not in Bangkok . Consider carpooling or splitting a cab . Ride-sharing services are also a fantastic option that can potentially be even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking the bus and/or the train is a great way to save . <p> Should you be travelling to Don Mueang Intl Airport , board the A1 bus outside the terminal and alight at the Mo Chit metro station . We advise you to install the Moovit application on your smartphone to help you with this as it will use the GPS ( if available ) to alert you on where to alight . <p> If you are travelling from beyond Asia or flying a non-budget airline , chances are that you will land at Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangkok instead . This airport has a railway station attached that can take you straight to the city centre . <p> The closest metro/light rail stations to the convention venue are the Makkasan and Phetchaburi stations . The venue is a 10 minute walk away from them . <p> Again , this is a case where one size does not fit all . Bangkok has a plethora of accommodations for travellers ranging from shared dormitories up to entire villas up for rent . Travelling in a group is always encouraged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to split the cost for accommodation should you prefer a hotel . <p> The hotels within walking distance of the venue are rather posh and may not be suitable for the budget traveler . However , as the convention centre is located near a metro station , this opens up the options for travelers . If you are able to procure a room near any station on Bangkoks integrated metro and light rail service , you will still have relatively easy access to the convention venue . <p> Okay , we concede here . Its hard to hold back on spending on food when you 're in one of the gastronomic capitals of Asia . However , this does n't  necessarily mean that splurging is a must . <p> Street food is a part and parcel of Bangkoks colourful culture . For the weekend , we advise setting aside about 50 USD for food and drink . Its a generous estimate but it is best to safe than sorry . <p> To our Muslim attendees , we advise setting aside a little more money as Halal food is not as abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consider packed food from supermarkets as an option - not only does it save you time and money but it is also convenient . <p> Above all , packing a couple of packets of ramen or instant noodles would help you save on your food expenses and they are a really fast way to resolve late night hunger pangs without losing too much sleep . Plus , ramen parties with friends are really fun and a great way to spread the magic of friendship ! <p> A lot of thought went into deciding the ticket price for Project SEAPonyCon . From our initial promise of ensuring that the ticket price is below 50 USD , we finally set the ticket price at 1,000 Thai Baht or 28 USD . <p> We promise that the tickets will be on sale at the door during the convention for this price as well . We know that not everyone has access to electronic banking , so we try not to discriminate . <p> We also have an offer for those travelling in groups . If you pre-register in a group of 5-15 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ticket package for groups of 8 which include an apartment rental . <p> At the time of writing , the online exclusive **25;30;TOOLONG campaign is still available , so here 's your chance to get your ticket to Project SEAPonyCon for just 900 THB - 10% off the usual price . <p> Yes . We understand that Project SEAPonyCon is the most expensive Southeast Asian pony convention to date , and is the second most expensive in Asia , next to Japan PonyCon . Why does it cost so much ? <p> Project SEAPonyCon is aiming to raise the bar in Southeast Asia . After extensive planning and study trips to BronyCon and Trotcon among others , we want to bring the convention experience of the west to Asia and put our own signature twist on it . Hence this is why we went so far as to get a VA all the way from the other side of the world to attend our convention . Project SEAPonyCon will be Andrea Libmans first trip to Asia , and it will also make Project SEAPonyCon the first pony convention in Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention experience is priceless . Spending quality time with friends is also priceless . For everything else , however , there 's a price tag . <p> How much you want to spend at a convention is entirely up to you . There are some things to consider , of course - one of them being autographs and photos with a VA . <p> Contrary to popular belief , this is not free of charge . Autographs and photographs with VAs and show staff at pony conventions can cost 20-30 USD each . <p> In the spirit of making the pony convention experience accessible to all , Project SEAPonyCon has secured a price of just 600 THB for a photo or autograph with Andrea at the convention . We completely signed away any profits for the convention that we could derive from autographs and photos and instead , passed the savings down to our attendees . <p> Of course , one can not forget the vendor halls and the vast variety of wares materialised by the amazing artisans of this fandom . Its hard to resist buying everything that tickles your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget that everything you buy will add to the load you carry . If you travelled by air to the convention make sure that your purchases do not cause you to exceed your baggage limit . The penalties and/or extra charges imposed by some airlines can be severe , to the point that you may have to leave some of your purchases behind instead . <p> If you are looking for a memento of the event instead or looking for bargains , hold off visiting the vendor hall until the last day of the convention . Some vendors lower their prices drastically to clear their stocks so be there when that happens ! <p> That 's pretty much all there is to it ! With six months left before Project SEAPonyCon , there 's still time to arrange everything you need . Do n't  hesitate ! The sooner you prepare , the better . Lock in your journey with us now and well see you at Southeast Asias most anticipated pony convention !

Painted Pictures <p> So I do enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours into to perfect , but sometimes I need more than just a high resolution copy that 100 other people have . I want the original . That one and only copy I can hold . For me that usually means something not digital . And if you want something unique , you need to look beyond simple inking and prismacolors to a time honored medium . Some of my favorites are pastels , oils paints , and even high end marker . I am , however , a huge sucker for watercolors . Nothing gets bills thrown into an artists face from me , faster than water colors . Trying to wrangle colored water onto paper is like sorcery to me . The above picture is water color by Dracontiar . I 'm showing you just the one to show the medium more . <p> Many times a print or copy is based of a physical original .

In a way its not just a piece of art you get , its the entire story of its creation , from idea through execution and the relationship you can build with an artist . <p> #5 To Kiss A Pony ... Drinkware <p> Who does n't  want to put a pony to their lips ? No , kissing horse mouth is not why I wanted to mention these . First . I love these guys because they are functional .

Glasses like these can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a few types of each . For colored you can either have painted , like the Twilight shot glass here or printed on , like the DHN one to its right . Etching the glass is much more permanent , and dishwasher safe , than a painted or printed glass that can have the image scratched off but has the drawback of only being frosted and in some cases , hard to see . For techniques , from left to right , the Rainbow Dash stuff is laser etched , the custom stuff is sand blasted and the Derpy glasses are acid etched . Acid etching is the cheapest to do but its hard to get consistent results . Laser etching is the pinnacle of the three methods and provides the most accuracy of image , though I have heard it can be difficult to use on a rounded surface like glass . Its also pretty expensive for someone to invest in which is why sandblasting is a great alternative . There is some dialing in to do and it can get messy but a skilled artisan can produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translates to the customer which is why I got a 120 custom etched wine glasses for my wedding like the one shown . <p> So not only are these great for drinking out of , but they too can have that personal design . I think they make great gifts , as the wedding glasses were also the favors everyone got to take home and the Borg glass there was commissioned by a friend for me . While a down side is they can break if they 're glass , I think they are pretty refreshing regardless and a must have for anyone who consumes liquid . What would you drink from a pony ? <p> #4 50 Shades Of Pone ... Fanfiction Prints <p> Not everyone is into it , but I love me some fanfiction . I remember reading old stories featured here on EQD that were just links to Google Docs . I love it when an author gets such a huge following that a dedicated group gets together to do more edits , tweaks and formating , then get it all bound into a real book you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a first hardback edition printing is the must have . <p> Instead of your favorite pony , or another commissioned piece of your OC , these physical manifestations of the hard work and dedication of fans are like trophies of not only what the writer has accomplished , but of what the fandom has as well . A commission in another way , these prints are usually all pre orders and only enough are made to fill them . I 'd recommend everyone jump on the chance to own one and to be on the lookout for future printing projects . What fanfic do you think should be printed ? <p> #3 Lurking In The ShadowsShadow Boxes <p> These are just so amazing and there are n't too many people in the fandom who do these beautiful things . These 4 here were created by The Paper Pony and they literally take art to another dimension . With a tilt of your head you are no longer looking AT a scene but looking INTO one . After an initial drawing , each individual layer and piece gets drawn again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I picked up the X-Acto knife . <p> Like most of the pieces here Ive mentioned , because a fan just like you is making it , it can be commissioned to specs and you get a piece that is more personal to you .

The one on the right was commissioned by my wife as soon as I proposed to her at Nightmare Nights Dallas . She also got me the center bottom one to celebrate my second year of working with BABSCon . So many great memories I get to be reminded of when I look at these ! <p> #2 Ponies33D Printed Models <p> I am a huge fan of the official merch , but there is just something special about a fan made 3D printed pony .

I used the pair up here as cake toppers for my wedding and were made by Clawed-Nyasu . I feel a lot of people miss out on the opportunity to get a pony commissioned in any pose they want ; a pony to hold and feel . And if you 're wanting to do an OC , you get to work with the artist to answer the tough questions like " What does the back of your head look like ? " and " How big is you flank ? " <p> #1 Art Of The Plush ... Plushies <p> Plushies are something we feature a lot here at EQD and for some rabid fans , certain colors , fabrics , and shapes separate a great plush from a fantastic one . I have a few favorites plushie makers but these four here were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I actually got Rainbow Dash here after forcing my way into the shutting down vendor hall at the infamous Las Pegasus Unicon . <p> Again , what makes these amazing pieces of merch is not just the quality , but the ability to commision and get , not only Applejack in her Gala dress , but a plush of your own OC as well . But be warned : If you require a high level of detail , like a cyborg OC covered in lights , tubes , and armor , combined with commission waiting lists , it could be a while before you can hug your pony . Borg here was one and a half years in the making due to the level of detail his maker forced herself to put into him and at times had to learn new techniques in order to get him done . <p> So these are just a few of cool things I have collected and commissioned over these few years .

I love how these two interact with each other and how Maud knows to just be patient.This is one of the few story animatics I found as a lot of them are stellar PMV roughs . <p> This is a stellar video about following your dreams , and never giving up . From a not so great start at the beginning , we get to watch our hero improve and improve and get even more amazing , reaching out to touch hearts . <p> #8 <p> Confrontation / Jekyll and Hyde Series <p> This one 's a bit different as there are three different videos tackling this incredible song . <p> We have Luna and Nightmare Moon battling for control .

My favourite of their works has to be the Count of Monte Cristo Musical numbers , as they take our favourite ponies and put them in new and sinister positions . <p> This is one of the rarer ones I 've spotted . It 's an animatic for a film rather than a PMV . It 's hauntingly beautiful and these guys are reaching for the stars . From what I 've seen though , they 're going to shoot past the stars and go into the wider solar system . <p> Even before ponies , I 've always enjoyed all type of animation and stop-motion holds a special place in my heart .

What cemented thi one in my heart was a few things . <p> First of all , I think we all grew up with that dancing frog from the Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show right ? This is the song he 's singing the chorus from . Secondly , is how this is the Doctor and he uses the Tardis to great effect . I also love Derpy 's expressions in this as she goes from confused to mad to forgiving to annoyed again . <p> This one was a bit controversial when we posted it .

If you have ever played any of the Final Fantasy games , these guys were the ones to deliver it to you . They are an icon in the Japanese RPG genre , with an armada of developers working on just about every genre out there within their ranks . <p> Can they handle our cute cartoon equines though ? Technically they have already teamed up with Hasbro in the past for Monopoly , and are known for their crazy collaborations in the form of Kingdom Hearts and it 's Disneyfantasy fusion . Below the break , we dive in and find out ! <p> They already did it ! <p> Good old Square Enix . They have had a few rocky patches over the last decade , but love em ' or hate em ' , there is no doubt that they have created some of the greatest and most memorable games of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but some of their biggest gambles have paid off tremendously well . <p> These guys already know how " cute , colorful , cartoony , yet adult " works thanks to their extensive partnership with Disney on the Kingdom Hearts lineup . If anything , this single point qualifies them more than anyone out there . They took a largely family friendly brand and melded it with a more adult oriented style to create one of the most compelling fusions we have ever seen in gaming . I remember way back in High School first hearing about it and thinking how absolutely ridiculous the merger of " Final Fantasy " and " Disney " sounded , yet here I am chomping at the bit for their 3rd , forever teased installment . That sounds exactly like my " brony " origin story ! <p> This is really good news for pony . Hasbro already wants to appeal to a wider audience than their original " girls under 12 " net from back in 2010 . With Guardians of Harmony showing that they are more than willing shed the shades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enix partnership for some epic pony-based story telling in a very similar setting would n't be difficult at all for the companies to pull off . Kingdom Hearts has always been about the protagonist chasing after his friends while making new ones and exploring worlds . The message is so close to pony is staggering ! And Square Enix has all the experience needed to do it again . <p> Of course , with their extensive collection of studios and communication between each , an action game like KH would n't be the only thing they could produce . These guys have a vast array of genres under it 's belt , from the simplest of puzzle apps to epic 100% story driven 40+ hour long journeys . Square is no stranger to investing an insane amount of time and money into a project for the sake of building an icon of the industry . Quality is always a huge deal for them . <p> This can sometimes backfire though . The " decade of Final Fantasy XIII " got nowhere near the level they expected it to attain due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of design choice flaws . They pumped a ton of resources into specific areas while neglecting others , and it burned them in the end . They 've spent most of the last few years trying to make up for lost ground , and few will consider the FFXIII saga to be anywhere near as important as their earlier installments . <p> A lot of things have changed for the better though . They learned some important lessons , first with the blinder mentioned above , and second via the absolutely terrible launch of Final Fantasy XIV . With two major projects essentially flopping , a rethink was in order . On the MMORPG front , a new team stepped in with an entirely different mindset , transforming a total failure into one of the most popular games in the genre . On the other side , Final Fantasy XV is already showing a willingness to fix everything that was wrong in it 's fellow single player predecessor . <p> The future looks bright for these guys with lots of exciting press and open showings for upcoming titles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for a pony game to actually pass their huge quality bar , but I think I could trust Square Enix with the keys to Equestria ! <p> Hopefully you are all having fun with this series , I know I am .

@@77555915 @6255915/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> Hey guys ! So I do n't have much editorial experience , but when Seth asked if I wanted to give my thoughts on the top songs from the season just gone , I figured why not ! Season 6 had a lot of pretty awesome songs , with a total of 12 to choose from , so if your favourite is n't here it is n't because it 's bad , it 's just not one of my own personal favourites . So , make sure to check below the break from my top 5 songs from the season ! <p> Number 5 : Say Goodbye To The Holiday <p> Over half of the tracks in this season were from the one episode , A Hearth 's Warming Tail , so it 's almost inevitable that a couple of my picks would come from that episode . Some of the songs in this episode were a bit generic , however that was n't necessarily as much of a problem for Say Goodbye to The Holiday . I love a good villain song , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the more complex-sounding instrumentals in the season , the strong singing of Kelly Sheridan is just the icing on the cake that make this song stand out to me a lot more than most of the other songs in the episode . <p> Number 4 : Find The Purpose In Your Life <p> Gabby Griffon is a pretty great new character for the show , and the song Find The Purpose In Your Life is just about as full of energy as she is . The verses are a great bunch of fun with especially amusing lines such as ' Help you teach pre-calculus , scrub the floors wo n't make a fuss ' helping to keep attention throughout the song , and the CMC deliver a pretty great chorus ( Babs Seed best CMC song still ) . This is probably the most traditional-sounding song on the list , as the instrumental does n't deliver anything particularly out of the ordinary , but it absolutely manages to achieve what it needs to . <p> Number 3 : It 's Gon na Work <p> Standing out mostly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the season , It 's Gon na Work is a breath of fresh air drawing heavily on Bollywood-style music . Pinkie and Rarity work great singing together in tandem , and put together a compelling narrative in the context of the episode . The instrumental 's catchy beat works wonderfully with the vocals , and it 's really cool to see even in the 6th season completely new styles of music being brought to the table . <p> Number 2 : Out On My Own <p> I have n't always loved the CMC , and Applebloom especially has had one or two especially underwhelming episodes . However , I think this song really highlights how well Michelle Creber 's Applebloom-style vocals can work incredibly well . The relatively low key instrumental works very nicely , slowly building throughout the course of the song whilst still managing to be relatively understated . The guitar helps make the track feel distinctly Applebloom , and the twangy-ness of the vocals fits in with that wonderfully . <p> Number 1 : Luna 's Future <p> So , it 's probably pretty obvious by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but my favourite show song from season 6 by a mile ( and probably one of my favourites from the show in general ! ) is , of course , Luna 's Future . When I heard that Aloma Steele had done some singing for MLP , I was super excited to hear it , because I 'm a big fan of her work on other projects ( most notably some Monstercat tracks ) . Her vocals perfectly suit Luna 's demeanour in the context of the episode , and the instrumental is brilliantly composed . The epic orchestral backing , swelling at just the right moments , wonderfully aids in adding the perfect atmosphere to the track . A magically memorable piece of music , this is definitely the kind of music I would love to see more of in future episodes . <p> So , that 's my top 5 songs from this past season , but what do you guys think ? Do you agree with me at all or do you have completely different thoughts ? Make sure to give it some discussion in the comments !

@@77555922 @6255922/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> We Are Borg back again with another 2015 Top 10 . Over the past week I have watched over 100 PMVs that were released last year and that does n't  even count the simple PMVs or the fantastic custom animation projects . Everyone thought I was crazy for watching every single one through its entirety but I was determined to bring you the cream of the crop , from beginning to end . It was really hard to choose just 10 and really I feel you could rearrange this list in any order . All these editors did a fantastic job . <p> In years past we 've been wowed with kinetic typographies , intense After Effects work , amazing lipsyncing and perfect timing . This years top videos were able to take all of those elements , balance them and really blow us away . We loved picking videos that were plain fun and some that had deeper meanings . <p> Also , we called 2014 the year of collaboration , but with with 6 of our Top 10 being collaborations , our 2105 PMVs truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MrDeLoop is a contributor in a few of our other top 10 entries , but this solo of project of his really stuck out to us . In the making since 2012 , this PMV was finally released last May , and actually has the highest view count of any video on our list . <p> This video features a crazy song , crazy effects , and a crazy pink pony . Get you Pinkie Pie here ! <p> The basis for every PMV is the song its animating , so the BritPop Lemon Tree by Fools Garden was an interesting first ingredient for this video . We were thrilled with RayteRs use of backgrounds , typography , and visual effects to really work with the lyrics . With only 290 subscribers you really need to go follow this guy ! <p> Rainbowdashzx released a number of PMVs in 2015 but we feel this collab of Centuries by Fall Out Boy was one of the best of the year . Our first collab in the list , this video is a great example of how different people with different styles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching it twice ; it does n't get old . <p> The Collaboratory amazed us multiple times this past year , and we practically had to decide which of their videos to not put on the list . This team of veteran editors bring the good stuff in The City with custom animation , show clips , typography and some stuff I can describe in three words or less . So good , you 've probably already seen it . <p> Back to back , The Collabortatory is relentless in bringing us amazing collab work , excellent song selection , and editing skills that makes everything I 've ever done look like an MSPaint meme . That opening lipsync with the CMC is the best . <p> This team released 4 PMVs in 2015 and our list has 3 of them . Check this one out then be sure to find these guys again below . <p> Certainly not the last song we 'll list where the editors work with the message of the song and deliver something not only entertaining but touching as well . Its great seeing collaborators with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well have to interview some of these collab leaders to see if its anything like herding cats . <p> PMVs that take a long time to make seem to be theme . Be sure to watch these guys hard work . They earned the spotlight . <p> Alanj2007Games and crew got a few PMVs in our final list we choose the Top 10 from . All the collaborators did a great job with effects , typography , and some custom animation , but also carrying a theme throughout . <p> While its hard to rate these at all , let alone pick 10 from 100 , we chose this one not only because it 's an amazing video , but the message it sends to those fighting depression . Were suckers for feelsy things like that . <p> So , this video was a while in the making , but it was definitely worth the wait . Not overly filled with effects , it shows a troubled relationship between the two Alicorn sisters . At the end , it shows Twilight as the trapped game piece on the masters board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even with under 6,000 views and just over 2 minutes , you 'll find yourself hitting repeat just to see it again . <p> Our only Equestria Girls PMV on the list , this video pulls most of its footage from Rainbow Rocks . It really blew us away with is fluid transitions , fantastic lipsyncing , and stunning visuals at 60FPS . <p> Also a collaborator on some of our other featured videos , Racecarghost really shows off his skill for a well earned #2 . <p> Our third pick from The Collaboratory , this video is the perfect balance of everything you can put into a PMV . The songs creators , Pendulum , says the song has a message that speaks out against violence . In this video the editors show the devastation and seemingly life threatening situations our favorite mares have to face , and in the show it looks easy , but if you apply just a shred of realism to it , these situations could take their toll . This perfect blend of not only the technical and visual aspects of the video , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto its intended meaning , is what puts Witchcraft in our number 1 spot . <p> It was so hard to pick just these 10 and I 'm pretty sure I hit the subscribe button dozens of times while making this list .

@@77555940 @6255940/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> While many earth ponies find satisfaction in their lack of magical prowess , one pony seems to have unlocked the very secrets of the universe . What are her limits ? Where did these abilities come from ? How does she plan on using them ? We were hired by Celestia herself to analyze and report on Pinkie Pie in an attempt to better understand her capabilities , and determine if they are either a threat or a boon to Equestrian society . Will she eventually crack and destroy the world ? Or is she here to bring the pony race to a new age of enlightenment ? After six years of monitoring and investigation , our report is now available for the masses . Find it down below . <p> Impromptu Disguise <p> Pinkie Pie 's uncanny ability to assume the likeness of her friends is something that has been compared to that of the Changeling . With almost no magical energy at all , she can dawn a flawless representation of her best friend Fluttershy , as was spotted in the Crystal Empire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at the moment it appears to be image only , meaning her voice would still give her away . Threat Level:Minor <p> Helicoptor Tail <p> The wonders of flight have been long sought after by the Earth Pony race . Many incredible inventions have been created in order to allow them to join their pegasus brethren in the skies , from the grand zeppelins of Canterlot to the more personalized via gliders and hoof-powered gyrocopters . Even Pinkie has been seen using one in the earliest days of this investigation.As of two years ago , she now has the ability of powered flight simply using her tail . This suggests that her powers are evolving , a scary prospect . The power itself is nowhere near the level of flight that a unicorn or pegasus can attain though , so for now we consider it a low priority . Threat Level : Minor <p> Pinkie Sense <p> So far , the famed and already studied " Pinkie Sense " seems to have taken a back seat to her host of other newer abilities . As far as we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving her a heads up on danger or things that are about to happen . Since we rarely see her use it now days , it can be assumed that she has found a way to internalize it , or she no longer needs it as her powers continue to evolve.Threat Level : Minor <p> Mane Manufacturing <p> On multiple occasions Pinkie has been spotted extracting objects directly out of her mane ; many of which are much larger than the actual perceived space available within it . Oddly enough , she still appears to prefer to use saddle bags , along with the more traditional " lay it across the back " storage even with this power , meaning the current hypothesis is that the space is actually limited . Unfortunately she has pulled out weaponry before in the form of baseball bats , making us wary about what else she might be storing up there . Threat Level : Moderate <p> Body Part Extension <p> Pinkie Pie appears to be able to extend and morph her body parts at will , allowing her to reach far away objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this elasticity ability , allowing her to squeeze them through tiny holes to monitor areas without actually entering them . At the moment we have not seen her morph any of her limbs into sharp or dangerous objects , so while extremely disturbing in many instances , it does not seem to pose a danger to your average Equestrian citizen . Threat Level : Minor <p> Super Stealth <p> We are not sure how Pinkie is able to accomplish this one . Is it done via micro-portals summoned at will ? Is it a variant on the earlier body part extension , but retraction instead ? If option one , she seems to have a way to monitor and see her friends from afar , either by hidden cameras hidden throughout Ponyville or by more magical means . Option two would suggest she has some strange uncanny way to know exactly where her friends will be in the future , and hide in nearby objects in preparation . Either way , if used in the wrong hooves , this capability could prove to be a huge threat to the privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drill Mane <p> The bowl and spa in the previous category were both analyzed a year ago to make sure there was n't some kind of hidden tunnel system built throughout Ponyville that only Pinkie Pie knew about . After it was discovered that her mane could actually act as a drill , it was one of the biggest theories as to how her strange ability to pop up anywhere seems to work . Fortunately the foundation of Ponyville seems secure , as we could find no evidence of digging outside of known instances that she took part in . <p> Regardless , the ability to dig under buildings or wreak havoc via accidental sinkholes ca n't be ignored . It is recommended that she take a class on structural integrity and geology before a disaster actually does happen . Threat Level : Moderate <p> Nasal Storage <p> Similar to her mane , or simply an extension of the mane ? Is she actually pulling things out of her body through her mane ? Was this sneeze simply a " leak " of her inner-pocket ? Many mysteries have appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that she simply stores confetti in her nose for the sake of making her sneezes more interesting . Based on her personality profile and need to make everypony around her laugh , this would n't be too far fetched . Threat Level : Why ? <p> Self Dismemberment <p> At the moment , we have 0 idea why this would be a good idea or what she actually accomlpishes by doing it , but it does bring on another theory on how she seems to " store " herself in various locations.Threat Level : Why ? <p> Body Part Multiplication <p> One of the most startling instances we came across in our investigation was the sudden appearance of multiple pink hooves surrounding the camera lense , as if she had invaded the internal mechanics and implanted pieces of herself within . Even more startling was out realization that they were not within our camera , but instead somehow a part of our vision . 19 hooves suddenly taking up our periphery without any way to remove them . The act was short lived , but my entire team spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hacked . <p> We have no idea how she did it or what the goal was , but the ability to implant images in the brains of others is n't something to take lightly ; if that is even what happened . Threat Level : High <p> Stomach of Holding <p> A typical layer of wedding cake is 250 calories a slice at 10 slices per . The cakes in Equestria are anything but typical , so let 's go ahead and add another 100 calories per slice to make up for the couple inches of frosting and chocolate . That 's around 3500 calories a layer . We 've seen her devour several layers at a time , along with piles of cupcakes and cookies . <p> Let 's say she downs a 3 layer cake plus a bunch of other food , as she regularly does . That 's around 12,000 calories . To burn that at around 105 calories a mile , you would need to run 114 miles or walk 220 . Since little ponies are .. little , they probably do n't weigh nearly as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain a healthy weight while taking such huge chunks of calories in . She 's also resisting all sorts of diseases that come with massive spikes in sugar and carbohydrates . Diabetes is something that can and does happen in horses , plus the usual heart attack and stroke from all that cholestorol . Is her stomach simply a void ? A food singularity that will keep on consuming over the course of millions of years until it eventually erupts and consumes her too ? Or does the food pass right on through requiring hundreds of restroom breaks a day ? Maybe she secretly sends it all to another dimension to feed an army of clones she plans to take over the multi-verse with ? Much of this is conspiracy . At the moment , the only scare is that she will , over time , start to consume too much , but with the current ease of access to food in Equestria , it 's not too worrisome . Threat Level : Minor <p> Self Explosion <p> It could be that she simply has a biological rocket built in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She pretty clearly has some form of propulsion out of her rear end if the scene in " A Friend in Deed " is any indication . Not only does she launch herself into the sky via a blast of energy ... from behind , but she also radiates the excess from all directions in a brilliant display of fireworks . Testing has been done on this energy to make sure it is not harmful in any way , and all results have deemed it safe . There is a fear that she might lose control of it in a populated area one day though , so for that reason we do consider it a priority . Threat Level : Moderate <p> Destruction of The Modern Laws of Physics <p> Ever since we were foals on the playground , we have seen the beauty of physics at play . When you sit at the top of a slide and push forward , gravity eventually takes over and you slip down . That 's not how Pinkie uses one . Her very nature seems to defy every law of physics in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is something only ever seen from Discord.When a pony is not controlled by the same natural laws of other ponies , it creates a certain level of fear within the populace . Even her friends seem put off by her abilities whenever she openly uses them . How far this go is still a mystery , but for now , it 's something to be very closely monitored . Threat Level : HighVideo evidence <p> Communication With Another Dimension <p> One of the scariest things our investigative team has seen Pinkie Pie do is communicate with what appears to be a completely separate dimension . At first we thought she was simply imitating a mime , but closer inspection of her hooves and body parts seems to indicate an actual tangible invisible barrier that do not exist when other ponies attempt to do the same thing . Many instances of her staring off into the distance or even talking to the inhabitants of this world have been documented . She has even pulled Princess Twilight into what she reported be a completely dark void between worlds . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alien species monitoring our world ? Are they seeking a way to invade us ? Or are they peaceful like the Breezies ? Thread Level : High <p> Life Extension <p> Notes found within Pinkie Pie 's secret party planning room seem to hint that she plans her events far into the future , 500 years far to be exact . Oddly enough , this was in regards to her parents , who are simple rock farmers and almost nothing like her . As far as we know , the Pie Family do not share Pinkie Pie 's abilities , which seems to hint that she may have a way to extend both her and the lives of the ponies around her.There is no evidence of dangerous rituals or sacrifices for her to accomplish this , and could even be a great thing for society if she shares her secret . She could also just be suffering from some rare form of OCD , where an afternoon of party planning turned into the planning of 500 years in advance for no reason other than to satisfy some weird urge.Threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest level unicorns and Discord are capable of the act of teleportation . It 's something no one ever expected to see out of a pony . Oddly enough , hers seems to be much more related to the draconequus 's natural ability rather than any kind of spell casting . She even randomly slaps a silly dimension-ripping sound on there sometimes . I 've mentioned above that most of her powers seem very similar to Discord , and while he has been somewhat reformed , there was still a huge gap of time where Equestria as a whole was thrown into complete and utter chaos 1000 years ago . If it was simple unicorn spell teleportation , I would be less wary , but the way she does it has me worried for what is to come . Threat Level : High <p> Final Report <p> Celestia is tight-lipped about the origins of Discord , and ignores all inquiries I bring to her when comparing Pinkie Pie to the much-assumed God of Chaos . It is unknown where he came from or how he attained his powers . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future party pony demand a world of celebration as opposed to madness ? At the moment , she seems only to use her powers for good , but there are many moments where we see her slip into some strange form of madness . Luckily she has not gotten violent or destructive during these phases , and with such excellent friends keeping her happy the instances are rare.Pinkie 's powers are vast and still completely unexplainable , but if she continues to use her powers for good , I see no reason to fear .

Let 's talk about EQD and THE FUTURE ! <p> After six years of largely living off of word of mouth , we 've decided to try some actual advertising out . Our buddies over at WeimTime LLC ( Whom you may recognize for all those Synthesia piano videos we post ) got their team together to do something we truthfully did n't have the expertise to pull off on our end . As he puts it : <p> WeimTime:I believe in a strong community for the best content aggregation , so I took the bill of creating this as a gesture of showing how I believe it 's up to content creators to help bring back some life into the site that gave them life from the get-go . <p> We need the fandom 's help to get it out there though . So , why are we doing this and what can you do to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Why a Youtube ad ? <p> EQD has struggled with getting our name out there for a few years now . Unfortunately something about our site makes us rank terribly on Google . Search " My Little Pony " , " Brony " , etc , with recommended off , and we are on page three or even further down some days . Sites with a tiny fraction of our traffic that update once a week dominate page one . This means our discovery through Google is terrible . Every once in a while they throw us a bone for some random keyword but it 's rare . <p> On top of that , for whatever reason it has become commonplace to just screencap what we report instead of giving a link , usually on Facebook where a cropped image of an EQD post can get hundreds of thousands of views and no one knows where it came from . Similar to the Youtubers who have their videos re-uploaded ( freebooted ) there . This make it hard for people to discover the site . <p> The very design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites that will upload people 's content themselves , we typically embed a preview . Our comic and video posts are a good example . We embed and send you away to go sub or follow on the creators page . This helps them build up a following that incentivizes them to make more , but there is always a bit of attrition when it comes to people returning to us . <p> EQD right now is primarily loyal long-term members . Many have grown bored of our everyday posts and unwilling to give new people a shot . Big news and big releases do bring out the hibernating people , but they quickly return to the shadows . This has had the side effect of harming sections of the fandom 's creative side , with less people looking at their stuff , they find less incentive to make it . This Luna animation from a week ago is a good example . It 's absolutely incredible and really deserves way more views . I hate seeing it not at at least 100,000 by now . While older creators have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success in the 2012-2014 era , New people are struggling more than anyone . <p> The Youtube algorithm a lot of the times just requires a kick to get something going outside of luck , and that 's what we have always done . 15,000 video views from EQD in 2013 would push someone into the " recommended " sections , and they would get 100,000 to a million views from it . If they released consistently , they built subscribers . <p> So Where Do We Find New People ? Fresh Eyes ? <p> It turns out an insane amount of kids are growing into MLP just like we all did . Six years ago , many of us discovered the new show through websites and forums . These days it 's all happening on phones and tablets , via apps , social networks , and Youtube . Quite a few brony video makers have discovered the flood of kids via luck of the draw with the algorithm . They love the stuff many veteran bronies are bored of , but have no idea a site like EQD exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to say EQD is the only way to become well known in pony , but I still think having a strong centralized quality controlled place like this has always been a huge boon for people who get lost in the flood of Youtube , Deviant Art , and Tumblr . Some of the biggest names in pony grew out of us spotlighting their things on here . We just need to get some fresh eyes to flood people with so new creators can get similar treatment . <p> TL ; DR HOW DO I HELP ? <p> Ask anyone that knows me , and they all agree I suck at asking for help . It goes against whatever weird nature I have . But here we are ! We need you . <p> If you have any time at all to spare , please take the video and share it wherever you possibly can , or even just toss it a like . Even places you assume we are already known . You 'd be surprised at how many people do n't know they can get all this stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upvoted Youtube comment can help with how rabid the fanbase is becoming over there . They just have 0 ways to find us ! <p> We have a few video makers on board to show it off on their channels in the coming weeks , and hopefully more if any are willing , but nothing beats the power of all of you ! Take it to forums , comments , Youtube , Twitter , Facebook , or wherever else you frequent with pony fans and help spread the word . Even just tossing the video a like will help it win the algorithm war ! If we can get even a few new regular people it would help tremendously on getting both EQD and new creators some love . <p> Anyway , that 's about it on my front .

@@77555949 @6255949/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> If anything , the smirk on Apple Bloom 's face only made her even more infuriating . " Well , I 'd love to hear you say it , " she replied . Addressing the rest of the class now , her toothy grin grew wider . " Would n't you like to hear Diamond Tiara recite Celestia 's Prayer ? " <p> Backed into a corner by the apelike cheers of her constituents , Diamond Tiara had no choice but to accept . " If the media would n't mind turning off all their recording devices and closing their eyes ... " she said , doing her best to wipe away her sullen mood as the crowd fell silent on the other side of her podium . Did she know Celestia 's Prayer , Apple Bloom had the nerve to ask . Of course she knew it ! A baby with a concussion could 've recited the stupid thing ! <p> Now ... how did it start again ? <p> " Our Mother ... Art , who is up in heaven , " she began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thigh ... thy kingdom ... the magic kingdom ! As it is in Equestria in , um ... " <p> " Snakes ! Why 'd it have to be snakes ? ! " <p> By some miracle , the sudden shout turned every eye in the classroom away from Diamond . Unfortunately , its source evidently did n't see fit to stop once they landed on him instead . " I hate snakes , Scootaloo ! " Pipsqueak shouted from the back of the room , a dusty brown fedora on his head and a bullwhip looped around his hoof . " And Nazis , and communists , and uh ... um ... " <p> The attention of everypony around him finally brought a blush to Pipsqueak 's cheeks . With silence restored , Diamond took the opportunity to fill it again . " What are you doing ? " <p> Pipsqueak bit his lip , the small motion enough to send his hat sliding over his eyes . " It 's ... " he mumbled as he pushed it back up . " It 's the movie reference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we referencing ? " <p> " It 's The Campaign , idiot ! " Silver Spoon shouted from off-screen . " We voted on it last week ! " <p> " Well , I voted for Indiana Jones ! " Scootaloo shouted back , likewise out of the proverbial shot . <p> " It does n't matter what you voted for . We had a majority ! " <p> " Nuh-uh ! " <p> " Yeah-huh ! " <p> As confusion grew up into full-blown pandemonium , Sweetie Belle turned to Apple Bloom and sighed . " You 'd think he 'd know better by now than to do this every time . " <p> " Speak for yourself , " Apple Bloom muttered as she shoved a deck of playing cards back inside her desk . " I voted for House of Cards . " <p> My name is Aquaman , this is the " Crusaders of the Lost Mark " episode followup , and if you ask me , democracy is so overrated . Time to whip this thing into gear . <p> As far as I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the show 's triple-digit catalog that gets a song going before the credits even roll after the cold open . The only other example of that quick a start I can remember is " Magical Mystery Cure " --also a musical , and also an episode that ended on a pretty dramatic series-altering twist . Full points for thematic consistency , guys . <p> Minus ten or so for every time Apple Bloom makes this face in a sorely inappropriate context . <p> It 's also notably rare to see Pipsqueak pop up in an opening sequence--or , really , at all . This marks only his third appearance in a speaking role , but apparently he 's popular enough behind the scenes to be running for class office . Good on ya , little guy . ( And good on Sweetie Belle for being strong enough with her magic to lift him up completely for a contractually-binding hoofbump . ) <p> Student pony president , though ? Jesus , Morty Pip , you ca n't just add a horse word to a political word and hope it means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponies reference previous disasters that happened to the town--or in Pipsqueak 's case today , the unintended consequences of one . Aside from the fact that someone 's destroying something seemingly every other day , the rest of Equestria proper does n't seem to recognize Twilight and co. as non-proverbial protectors of the realm all that often . On the other hand , Apple Bloom did call out Applejack as one-sixth of the Equestrian Avengers Initiative last week , so maybe we 're seeing a positive trend towards recognizing their efforts in the future . In any event , " screw this playground ( and library ) in particular " seems a peculiar strategy for world domination . <p> At least aim for a community center or something , Tirek . Red Dawn in the making , this crew is not . <p> While we have a moment , let 's fill it with a shout-out to Amy Keating Rogers . According to her Twitter , this was the penultimate episode she 'll write for FiM , with the upcoming episode guest-starring Lena Hall being her last contribution . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying thanks , AKR , for five years of fantastic writing for the show . If I 'm not speaking for you in saying that , allow me to instead paraphrase Beth Sanchez in asking you to go stand in the corner , face the corner , and talk to nobody . <p> Definitely a pleasant surprise to see a much-beleaguered fan favorite like this after so long an absence . And look , Button Mash and Diamond Tiara are there too ! <p> I know she has her moment in the sun later , but Silver Spoon 's relationship with Diamond Tiara still stands out to me as somewhat unique in this show . She seems to split her time between Scorpan-tier crony and Flavor-Flav-tier hype mare , and all the while does a lot more legwork to maintain their status as Little Tikes(tm) tyrants than Diamond gives her credit for . It 's a weird friendship they have , but judging by Silver 's genuine excitement about her role in it , it is two-sided in a way . If you want to call that subtle establishment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's book and do nothing to stop you . <p> The point is , in any event : eat your diamond-encrusted , gold-clock-aligned heart out , boiiiiii . <p> Scrunchy face #as if anyone has a prayer of keeping track anymore , by the way . <p> The second song in seemingly as many minutes firmly establishes this episode as a musical , but it 's also a good example of how these kinds of interludes still have a role in the overall narrative of such a story . With only twenty-two minutes to work with , there 's very little room for anything that does n't directly advance an episode 's plot , and this song pulls double duty in that respect . In addition to establishing the protagonist 's position in the election , it gives us a look at not just how Diamond opposes them as the antagonist , but also how her character makes that bad-guy behavior a tangible threat to the good guys . The end of the episode frames her special talent as an ability to get other ponies to do what she wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of insults and intimidation--while at the same time , laying the groundwork for that third-act realization and turn-around . That kind of circular structure shows up in all efficiently plotted scripts , and it only seems like a simple thing to do because it 's executed so neatly here . <p> Put less academically : this is the expression of somepony who 's pretty sure the Equestrian medical community is going to name what she does to those stupid blank flanks after her . <p> This message paid for by the Unofficial Diamond Tiara Fan Club and Passive-Aggressive Sarcasm Society , which obviously you 're already a member of if you know what 's good for you . <p> With such a complex tune to work with , Diamond Tiarareally swung for the fences in her first significant singing role . It 's old hat to say Daniel Ingram and AKR are on their respective games for music and lyrics , but Chantal Strand nails it as both Diamond 's speaking and singing voices . <p> Do n't get her prickly . You wo n't like her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her cutie mark , it 's a ... look , it makes sense if you squint a bit , just ... just forget it . <p> " And there 's no better way to overpower a trickle of doubt than with a flood of naked **30;92;TOOLONG . " <p> On the subject of clowns and/or weird hats , it 's odd seeing Button Mash ( or at least , a reasonably close recolor of him ) break out of the background and interact with the scene here for a second . I 'd figured his cameo in " Slice of Life " about covered all the bases he was going to touch this season , but this seems to establish as a somewhat concrete background-classmate . Go figure . <p> Just on the off chance it means anything , I counted 32 total students in the one overhead shot we get of Ponyville Elementary 's voting population . Quite a step up for Cheerilee from when she only had to deal with 12 of the little darlings . <p> Sometimes coffee , chocolate , and the ever-looming threat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This show 's built up an admittedly thin list of moments that truly threw me for a loop , but among them now is Silver Spoon bailing on Diamond Tiara in the election . It 's far from undeserved , but it 's still a pretty heavy backhand to the status quo , and animation and voicework both point towards Diamond being a lot more hurt by it than she 's letting on . Guess friends really do make the worst enemies . <p> " You 're not the mare I knew five years ago . " " It 's not the years , Silver , it 's the sass ! " <p> And so enters Spoiled Rich , destroyer of headcanons . This first appearance for Filthy 's wife and Diamond 's very own Mommie Dearest contextualizes the way she is a lot more than I reckon anyone was expecting from this episode . That kind of pressure-cooker of a home life is bound to skew a young kid 's personality , especially when you can see how visibly afraid Diamond is when Spoiled calls her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers . <p> Something something , wire hangers ever . <p> " Would n't it have been easier to get a cart for that statue , Mother ? Or , I do n't know ... a puppy instead ? " " If that 's a veiled criticism about me , I wo n't hear it and I wo n't respond to it . " <p> Good to see that the " stroll around Equestria chuckling at the working class " industry is still booming . <p> As I 've phrased it to several friends at several points , Season 5 remains the may-as-well-be-official Season of Not Pulling Punches . From Moondancer to Luna to Big Mac to now Diamond Tiara ( and really , we could even throw Gilda and Troubleshoes in there ) , we 've seen several characters struggling with some very real ( and real-world-applicable ) issues that do n't always have a neat resolution . The third song here speaks to that and then some , and in a way it 's the first time Diamond Tiara 's ever " broken character " that we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't grow up that way by choice . In a different home with different folks living in it , someone with her initiative and intestinal fortitude--not to mention , that kind of dedication to putting her family before herself--would have no shortage of friends , or successes to share with them . Truth be told , I 've always suspected she and Apple Bloom were more alike than either of them realized , and all this sequence does is seemingly confirm that . After all , tragedy in a nutshell is showing a villain ( and the audience by proxy ) realizing they could 've been a hero instead . <p> Sometimes , diamonds are nobody 's best friend . <p> Ah , the rarest of endangered species : the Equestrian Nuclear Family . Genus Equus , species Monogamia , and nearly extinct from the late 80s all the way to 2010 . <p> Neat callback to " Call of the Cutie " here . Aesthetic improvements notwithstanding , this is the same square where Rainbow Dash first agreed to help Apple Bloom look for her cutie mark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit ' cause of how we basically stalked Diamond as she sang her way across town with little to no interference from any observing adult , but mostly it 's the Heel-Face Turn thing . " " Mm-hmm . " " Definitely mostly the second one . " <p> " It 's not like I wanted to go see your stupid clubhouse or anything . B-baka . " ( Disclaimer : I do n't actually know what that word means . I assume it 's a venereal disease . ) <p> Another unexpected angle to this conflict : Diamond Tiara really not having any more of a clue what her buttmark means than we the audience did for the longest time . More than I think a lot of us wanted to believe , it seems ponies really do n't have a firm grip on how cutie marks work , even with all of them having one of their very own to crinkle their brow at in the mirror . It 's interesting to see another case where somepony " discovers " their special talent years before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like being born , guys . You get a cutie mark , everyone cheers , they push you out the door , and then nothing makes sense for the rest of your life . <p> Presented without context because I made this bed for myself several followups ago , and so help me God I will lie in it with honor . <p> " The concept of cutie mark confusion was created by and for the Cutie Mark Crusaders , in order to make traditional Equestrian mark-manufacturing non-competitive . " - Aquaman , just getting that one topical LONG ... joke over and done with . <p> " Wait , was that ... somepony screaming ? " " Yeah . Pip gets antsy ' bout stuff a lot . " " ... but why is it coming from beneath the floorboards ? " " He forgot to pay club dues . " <p> " This is n't ' Nam , Pipsqueak . There are rules . " <p> " Light of Your Cutie Mark " is a lot more dramatically inclined than those preceding it , and it fits with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene changes get a little faster to keep up with the pace of the segment , and there 's a genuine tone of panic underlying the lyrics . You really get a sense that Diamond knows she 's making the wrong choice as well as the CMC do , and without knowing any other way to be , she 's doing everything she can to convince herself she 's in the right . Another layered conflict without a pulled punch to be seen . Have I mentioned I love this season yet ? <p> " Wait , Bon Bon ? I thought I just saw you at that party across town ? That 's where Lyra was telling everyone you 'd be when she was carrying around all those mane extensions yesterday . " " ... I 'll be right back . " <p> Listen to the CMC , Summer Diamond . School is n't a place for smart ponies . <p> I do n't know why it did n't occur to me sooner that of course Spoiled Rich is on the school board . Very rarely do soulless LONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " What in the name of Equestria is going on out here ? What was that ruckus ? " " Uh , what ruckus , Miss Rich ? " " I was just in my meeting and I heard a ruckus . " " Could you describe the ruckus , ma'am ? " <p> Tossing out a casual " their kind " in the midst of your daughter 's classmates of the last five years is a bold move . Ironically , the bourgeoisie never were ones for social graces . <p> " How could she say something like that ? " " I do n't even know what ' bourgeoisie ' means ... " " I do n't know what it means either , but I 'm pretty sure it 's a venereal disease . " <p> It 's okay , guys . Diamond Tiara dropping the F-bomb is a more-than-valid excuse for an internal BSOD . <p> I mean , yeah , I 'm joking about it , but at the same time , though : the specific phrasing Diamond uses in defending the Crusaders might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left field . That 's a huge turnaround **29;124;TOOLONG the show 's most notably consistent antagonist , and it really stands to testament to the old wisdom about how effective treating your enemies like friends can be . <p> Sidenote : Snails is just about Cheerilee 's height now . He and Troubleshoes ought to hang out sometime . Bond over all the doorframes they 've left forehead imprints in . <p> ... eh . We 've shipped worse . <p> In full and complete seriousness , though : if Diamond Tiara 's well and truly reformed now , I really want to see her and Rarity together in a future episode . We 've seen them both struggle with the balance between generosity and selfishness , and I could totally dig some mentoring from old hand at it to new recruit . Plus it 'd be an excuse for Sweetie Belle and Silver Spoon to do something together in the B-plot , and in case you 're wondering what " worse " refers to , it 's that . It 's that a whole lot more than I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything later ? " <p> Twilight 's search for a friendship problem to solve continues unresolved for another week . <p> Shades of " My Past Is Not Today " in the reprise of " The Pony I Wan na Be " , but I 'd vote for Diamond 's version hitting more of the right notes with me . Instead of concluding a redemption arc , this song sounds like it 's starting one off . And more to the personal point , this is really the first time we 've ever seen Diamond Tiara look truly happy , which admittedly qualifies as the kind of source bias statisticians lie awake at night thinking about . <p> Eat your eerily-precise heart out , Nate Silver . <p> I might be hearing things , but when the CMC decide that getting their cutie marks is n't as important as they 've thought all this time , I 'd swear the musical tones very subtly resemble the main theme . If I 'm right about that , it just goes to show how important these three and their growth as characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as technically supporting cast members . Between the theme of this season and their experiences before and during it , they 've grown enough as characters to not just live in the shadows of their more Harmonized big sisters , but ( especially now ) go out and cast some shadows of their own . <p> I mean , that or the ephemeral Spirit of Harmony just has a tendency to procrastinate . It 's a coin flip . <p> And all right , you know what ? Here 's the part of this thing where I break character . I have a pretty well-established formula for followups : I watch the episode live , I go back later in the day to gently poke fun at weird little quirks in the **26;155;TOOLONG wherever I can , and fill in the rest with irreverent pop culture references . Much as I like watching the show , I 'm able to distance myself from it and just enjoy playfully riffing off it for a bit . It 's uncomplicated , it 's relatively easy , and it 's a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this one . I did my best , and I think I still got some good material out in the end , but it 's by far been a bigger struggle than I ever anticipated it would be . Let 's not overstretch and call this episode " life-changing " by any stretch of the imagination , but in a lot of ways , it means a lot of things to a lot of people--and also a lot to me individually . Whether by sympathy for their situations or just a writer 's fascination with characters oft left on the sidelines , I 've grown quite attached to the CMC over the last five years . Seeing them achieve exactly what they 've wished for--and having watched them swing for it and miss time and time again--feels like something more than just the closure of a story arc . In a way , it 's indicative of everything we 've achieved too--we the show staff , we the fans , even we the guys who spend way too much of their free time blogging about technicolor horses . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the sign of how far we 've come . This is the success these characters deserve to have , and that we in some small part helped to create . It 's wonderfully dynamic , it 's been a long time coming , and I appreciate the holy crap out of it . Mocking that , however friendly the tone , is tough , and ending the episode on a recap of everything leading up to this accomplishment just made it tougher . Thanks for sticking around , y'all . <p> No screwing around in this caption . Congratulations , girls . You earned the hell out of those buttmarks . <p> And also not screwing around in this one either , because Applejack explicitly brings up their parents for the first time ever and everyone is crying on the outside and I will not cry over a childre n't cartoon THIS IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO FAIR <p> Slight point of order I really want to make clear , though : just because Scootaloo 's parents are n't visible at the end here does n't mean they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweetie Belle 's parents ( whom we know are real and proud and definitely aliveGOD DAMMIT EMOTIONS ) are n't there either . For another , Rainbow Dash has been a pretty consistent presence in Scootaloo 's personal struggle with her identity , so her being the one to fill that limited screen time I mentioned before makes a lot of thematic sense . And finally , the shot showing all the Mane 6 's marks tiled together with the CMC 's all but confirms a pretty inextricable link between all of their respective destinies . <p> To sum up : if you see one more Scootaorphan fic , they wo n't even give what I do to you a name , for fear of encouraging someone to repeat it . <p> Just to end on a high note , though : really lowkey hoping those cutie mark surfboards show up in an end-of-season boss fight somewhere down the road . Anything that enables more Tirek-tier fight scenes is the stuff I do like . <p> You really have no idea how hilarious it is that I 'm captioning this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to superheroes .

@@77555966 @6255966/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> Hello everyone and welcome to another edition of the Episode Rewatch series where every Saturday we take a look into the past to rediscover the foundations our little series budded from . As usual we 'll be exploring the notable moments in the episode and every little thing that has been ingrained in our fandom 's culture . <p> Today we 'll be taking a look at Swarm of the Century , the episode that introduced us to Parasprites , how listening to Pinkie can be a good thing ( and that she has mad musical skills , and that Parasprites make for the best Katamari Damacy . <p> Check on after the break for the episode link and the break down ! <p> The Face of All Evil <p> Swarm of the Century continued a stretch of episodes that many used to place on their must watch list when introducing people to the show . With a strong showing from all the cast , plenty of insanity that you would n't expect from a show with the name My Little Pony and the fact the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a solid episode to show off the show 's uniqueness . <p> It also showed off that Fluttershy is a merciless apple killer . Just look how nonchalantly she ended that poor apple 's life . <p> Interestingly enough this was also the first episode that M.A. Larson would write for the show followed by Sonic Rainboom and Cutie Mark Chronicles . Who would have known at this point that he would become the God of Wings , the Bringer of Alicorns ? <p> Also of note is that despite all these seasons Twilight is just as obsessed with impressing Celestia then as she is now . She managed to show a bit more restraint in season 6 but it 's nice to see little character traits like this still shine through today . <p> Derpy spotted so you do n't have to ! Plus Happy Lyra is Happy <p> There 's something else important in this little scene besides the short lived " We Could n't Fit It All In " meme and that is how enduring a lot of these background ponies have been since season 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Punch , Carrot Top , Derpy , Colgate , Lyra and Bon Bon ( to name the ones that come immediately to mind ) , all of which enjoy a following to this day . <p> Seeing these ponies all together got me thinking a bit : the most successful and enduring background characters we have in the fandom are the ones that have a blank slate and/or are doing a simple background action that drives the imagination . It feels like nowadays we 've been missing out on that magic , with most new characters the fandom has focused on being ponies that have had secondary roles in episodes . It might just be me , but I have a hard time thinking of a background character in recent seasons that exploded in popularity despite being on screen for a few seconds ( Button Mash for instance ) . <p> Pinkie my boy ! <p> By this point Pinkie had really started to grow on me and by the end of this episode that had really solidified for me . Sure she acts nutty , but she actually has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Also that Pinkie has to be some sort of eldritch God that is able to bend all of time and space . The evidence has only been mounting ever since . <p> At this point the Rainbow Dash Always Dresses in Style starting to take off and this outfit by Rarity certainly helped it along . Also it appears Rarity 's desire for giant head wear was in full swing . <p> If my memory serves me correctly I think this was the first time we got a look at Rainbow 's house and ever since it has blown us away and ever since we 've all wondered how Rainbow can afford such an awesome pad . <p> Regardless we do know that Rainbow has remodeled her house since season 1 considering how sparse her bedroom is . I guess Rainbow has a knack for redecorating ! <p> For all the times that a spell went right for Twilight it seemed like there were just as many instances where she had problems with her spells . A lot of people have complained of Twilight being too powerful over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , but taking a look back at the early seasons she may have been good at magic but was by no means a master . I think the skill she shows now is a natural progression of her training and education , showing us how much she has grown over these six long years . <p> Ah , where would we be without Rarity 's freakouts ? Even that has evolved over time , at least now she has her own set of feigning couches to help facilitate a more refined freakout . <p> Zecora in two episodes in a row ? When was the last time that happened ? It 's a shame that Zecora has n't been included more into the show and its lore . She 's an interesting character with a sort of knowledge that is quite unique to the characters in MLP . <p> I think Seth might have mentioned this before but I do miss Twilight 's little mental breakdowns , something our more mature Twilight has a better grip on nowadays . While it is nice to have our characters grow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just miss , heh . Though watching this particular scene it could be a pining for simple cartoony goofiness and exaggeration that I think some of the earlier seasons captured so well . Not to say there are n't any instances in later seasons but it does feel toned down a bit . <p> Ah , the scene that probably started it all in the Weird Al saga as it helped create the video called Pony Polka which eventually caught Weird Al 's attention . Not only that but we now know that Pinkie truly is the most musical pony in Ponyville . <p> Got to admit , it 's pretty cool to see a ruler that has lived for over 1000 years still discovering the wonders of Equestria ... <p> Or she is just playing coy . Oh Celestia , you were awesome in season one . <p> **28;183;TOOLONG <p> As season one began to approach its mid-point the show had really started to hit its stride ! We began to learn a bit more about this strange land called Equestria and the humble little village of Ponyville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had started to learn about these seven wonderful friends ( Spike included ! ) and what made them tick . By this point we have had a number of ensemble episodes that gave equal time to each pony and how they interacted together , expanding on the characters we had met just weeks before . Honestly I think within episodes like Swarm of the Century , Dragon Shy , and Bridle Gossip placed right before the middle of the season things would have been off to a rockier start , but thanks to them we had a solid foundation on why we thought this show was amazing and furthermore could be confident earlier episodes were n't just a fluke . <p> Plus so many adorable pony moments ! I mean , come on ! <p> With that , thanks to you all for giving this a read and even if you did n't I hope you enjoy reliving a piece of the past . We 'll see you next week with another Episode Rewatch ! 
@@77555967 @6255967/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> As we move into the mid-season of season 1 we finally arrive at the episode that introduced another set of characters that have played an all important role in the history of the show and the fandom : the creation of the CMC and the introduction of Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon . <p> While not considered an amazing episode at the time , especially since folks were upset that these young fillies were taking time away from the main cast , looking back on it you ca n't deny how important of an episode it was . After all , establishing these characters did bring some adorable sisterly and friendship interactions ! <p> Check on after the break for the episode and some highlights ! <p> If you did n't know at this point , butts play an important part in Equestria . In all seriousness , Call of the Cutie was one of the first episodes to tackle Cutie Marks and what they meant to ponies and how ponies get their marks . Very basic information by today 's standards , but who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crazy mare to create a cult of equality by removing said marks ? <p> We also got a bit of expanded lore on the life cycle of ponies by getting our first look at a really , really young pony . Too bad when babies were officially introduced they were n't as cute as Cheerilee here . <p> Speaking of Cheerilee , this was the same episode that made this look on her popular , though I think seeing her in her cheer leading uniform is more popular nowadays . Got to appreciate the classics though ! <p> Ah yes , the introduction of Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon . The show really did a good job demonizing the two over these many seasons and while it is nice the two of them have since been redeemed it feels a little odd having the CMC without an antagonist . <p> Twist was also introduced this episode , her only major appearance if I remember correctly . Even though Apple Bloom and Twist seemed to be friends I always found it odd how after this episode and after discovering that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . <p> Well , at least Apple Bloom found some new friends to hang out with instead of dwelling in solitary and depression over her friend getting a cutie mark . Who knows how she would have turned out then . <p> Is it just me or does it seem like Pinkie does n't have as many , or at least memorable , short songs anymore ? I always thought they were a cute little addition to the show . Always , it was nice to see Apple Bloom interact with members of the mane six , letting us slowly get used to Apple Bloom and the rest of the CMC as well as introducing a small amount of backstory into how some of the girls got their marks . <p> Derpy sighted so you do n't have to ! <p> We also got a fair number of background pony introductions/fandom lore thanks to this episode . For instance , Pokey Pierce was introduced . <p> And we learned about the horrors of pony alcoholism as Berry Punch indulged in her vice . <p> Finally the episode ends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girls would have a tough season ahead as , like I mentioned above , people complained about them taking episodes from the main cast . But as time wore on those feelings eventually subsided as they became just as irreplaceable as our main cast of characters . <p> Now that we 've taken a trip down memory lane , how about we dive right into the episode itself ? Get it down below and stay tuned for a new rewatch next week !

@@77555969 @6255969/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> We 've completed another season , and like with the last few , I always like to go back and reflect on some of the best new episodes to put in the ever-growing list of greats . It was hard to pick 10 here , and obviously this list may not reflect what you personally think , but that is what the comments are for ! <p> Below the break , get our picks for top 10 best episodes of season 6 ! <p> #10 <p> P.P.O.V <p> The #10 slot was pretty difficult to nail down with a lot of excellent contenders coming in for the end . P.P.O.V was one of those episodes that really changed up the usual pony formula , and gave us an interesting look at what goes on in the minds of one of each of the mane 6 at any given moment . <p> We did n't pick this episode because it was an incredible story . Realistically , the final " reveal " was a little ... lacking , but it completely dominated when it came to character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the Over-the-top duncy Pinkie through Applejack 's was interesting to say the least . It 's an episode that raises some complicated questions on what kind of friendships we have going on between the mane 6 , and how they actually see one another deep down . There was a sense of realism here where I 'm sure plenty of people out there see a friend in one way but vocalize a different point . <p> #9 <p> The Fault in Our Cutie Marks <p> Winner for one of the best new character additions ! Gabby is the type that could cheer just about anyone up . A griffon Pinkie Pie with loads of energy and surprisingly deep backstory . If I had to pick between her and Gilda for a future birdlion episode , it would n't be much of a challenge . <p> We were pretty light on Cutie Mark Crusader focused episodes this season , but what they lacked in quantity they made up for in quality . While Gabs may have stolen the show , these three were great in their own right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher on the list if it had more dungeons . I think a lot of us expected to get right in the action and see Discord dungeon mastering a slew of crazy references to oldschool D&amp;D . That being said , the long buildup actually worked pretty well , with character interaction we rarely get to see in the show . Even though I primarily watch MLP for our mare-filled super-cast , it was kind of refreshing just giving the dudes an episode . <p> I 'm probably going to get hell for this one , but if I was 100% in control of this list it probably would have been higher up . If you are a Starlight Glimmer fan because you love how she reminds you of oldschool Twilight with a slightly more chaotic/evil edge , this was a dream of an episode . The starting magic " duel " was an excellent way to show how much she has improved under Twilight 's tutelage , and seeing my favorite new Unicorn crafting brand new spells made the Dungeons and Dragons geek in me air guitar in excitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popped up . I do a lot of things when no one is looking . <p> She 's totally going to be the next Starswirl at this rate , and I love it . I already went into great deal on that topic though , which you can read over here . The episode was such a solid representation of the old trope of an curious wizard playing with new magic and screwing it up at grand levels . I ca n't ask for more from pony , or Glimmy . <p> #6 <p> To Where and Back Again <p> The way a lot of us watched this with the one day gap between really helped solidify it in my mind compared to other season-enders . Something about having an entire day rewatch , analyze , and blabber about what we think would happen made it all the better . <p> The general complaint outside of SUDDEN COLORFUL CHANGELINGS I saw was the idea that we 'd have an entire season finale dedicated to ponies other than the mane cast , but I honestly felt like that was super refreshing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so incredibly well together that the episode probably could have just been the four of them arguing for 22 minutes and been top tier . Trixie 's battle of wills with Discord , Glimmy 's growing confidence and friendshipping , and Thorax worldbuilding the changelings was a joy to behold . I 've caught myself a few times fishing for a screenshot for a post and ending up just watching a scene or two . <p> That being said .. <p> She was amazing She was hilarious She was loyal She saved the world Her coat matches her bestie perfectly Trixie for Mane 8th . <p> #5 <p> No Second Prances <p> BIAS Mode Activate <p> If you dislike Trixie or Glimmy , you probably were n't too fond of this one . If you have spent the last 6 years LOVIN ' the Trix and finding even more to love with Glimglam , this was the BEST . I already talked about how fun it is to team up ex-villains above . " No Second Prances " was the perfect example of an almost 100% dialogue centered Slice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly dark climax but comfy friendship in the end . What was the endgame of depressed Trixie ? We will never know for sure . <p> I know I 'm in a pretty small section of the fandom when I say I want to see way more of this pairing , but it was such a well done display of what two vastly different personalities with similar pasts can accomplish . Seeing it again in the finale was a joy . <p> #4 <p> Gauntlet of Fire <p> If you are like me , you probably were n't too thrilled at another Spike episode . He works so well as the logical herder of crazy ponies on the side , that his big dedicated episodes always feel a bit out of place . I 've come to expect him as the one to correct Twilight and friends when they are doing something dumb , and seeing him as the one making ridiculous mistakes always bothered me . <p> Luckily this one went a completely different direction and introduced some of the best lore of the season . We got an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great job of solving the issues laid out before him . He made some kiddy mistakes , but owned up to everything really well . A lot of respect was gained for the little guy in this one . I 'm sure we will see more Spike focused adventure in the future , and I have my fingers crossed that they end up treated like this . <p> #3 <p> Hearth 's Warming Tail <p> A relatively good chunk of people did n't like that pony went this route , but every major show out there has tackled the Christmas Carol episode . You can almost guarantee it will happen eventually if something lasts more than three seasons . Pony was due for it ... even it happened in the middle of summer . <p> For a purely ponified retelling , I think they did a tremendous job on it . The scene setting was perfect , the songs exciting , and the general pacing well done . It was n't one for the world builders or the character improvers , but from a purely entertainment standpoint it nailed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the roles each of the characters played was done exceptionally well . I think it would have been even better at mini-movie length like most Christmas specials do with th etopic , but for 22 minutes it still worked . <p> I think this would have been received better if it was actually around Christmas , but the mysterious scheduling overlords at Hasbro wanted it early , and I do n't mind missing the possibility of an extended hiatus or gap for the sake getting it to air later in the year . <p> #2 <p> Stranger than Fan Fiction <p> If Slice of Life was a shout out to the fandom , this was a parody of it . Everything about " Stranger than Fan Fiction " was taken directly from our hyper-critical fanbase , from Quibble 's nitpicking at every little thing , to the body pillows in the background . It was a picture of brony and fandoms in general , with both the light and dark sides put on full display . You can almost feel a sense of glee pouring through the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quibble . We 've driven them nuts over the years even if they probably love most of the attention in the end . <p> Aside from being fun in the satirical way , it 's also up here on this list because the episode itself was just really solid . We had a fun little totally platonic relationship between Dashie and her new bestie , with a bit of temple-delving on the side . It 's the type of episode that gives you lots to look for in the background while entertaining you with the story in the front , then leaving with lots to talk about when it 's over . <p> #1 <p> The Saddle Row Review <p> This is one of those episodes that really set itself apart in terms of overall plot writing . Some people are n't too fond of the re-telling narrative style , but for what it 's worth I think the team over at DHX nailed it .

@@77555973 @6255973/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> It 's something you guys wanted according to our survey and we 're happy to oblige ! We 're going to be tackling season 2 this time around starting with the episodes that brought us Discord : The Return of Harmony parts 1 and 2 . <p> Back in the day it was amazing to hear we had obtained such an amazing actor like John de Lancie for the MLP cast and even more amazing as time went on what staying power Discord would have over the show . <p> Check on after the break for scenes that made these episodes a great start to a brand new season we were n't even sure if we were going to get ! Sorry if it seems more like a followup but so many memes were born from this episode that it would I would feel remiss for not pointing them out . <p> Memes were in full swing with this particular episode and I swear most of my breakdown of this particular rewatch will be about them . Within the first couple minutes we had our first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While not as prevalent today it enjoyed a bit of popularity back in the day spawning from this little exchange : <p> Sweetie : That 's not a word ! Scootaloo : What are you ? A dictionary ? You just never know what little line , facial expression or action will serve as something for the fandom to latch onto . <p> Even back in season 2 Rarity was always prepared for any disaster . Whether it be fashionable survival gear or a variety of well placed fainting couches she is one prepared gal regardless of the circumstance . <p> We also clearly established Pinkie 's love for chocolate milk , especially of the rain variety . I remember this pic alone led to a guffaws and parody pics in the days after the episode aired . <p> The introduction of the stained glass corridor . A lot of things introduced in these two episodes would be found in later episodes of the show , expanding the world and lore of Equestria greatly and starting a trend in pony art to create fandom stained glass concepts ... <p> ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jokes that spawned from this one . <p> And the memes continue as folks teamed this animation up to " Everyday I 'm Shuffling " . Told you this was a meme heavy episode ! <p> And finally the man himself ! Discord is still a big deal even today but back when he first popped up people lost their minds . He was just so unique , posed such a great threat as a villain and he had such a great VA in de Lancie . What better way could a premiere be for a season ? <p> The rest of the episode was especially meme-tastic as we discovered some meme staples that persist in the fandom today , probably the most famous being LiarJack and her shifty eyed scrunchy face . The idea of Discorded ponies also was born here , working its way into fan works from art to fanfics . <p> As Seth mentioned in a previous rewatch , Rarity had yet to really find her place among the popular ponies of the gang , but I loved her from the start . The amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the start and this episode was no exception especially when she found her ' diamond ' . <p> My last big observation from the episode you can take as possible foreshadowing for Fluttershy becoming friends with Discord . Out of all the ponies she was the only one that could n't be Discorded by Discord indirectly showing that she is able to keep calm around him and talk to him even when he is acting like typical Discord . Even though it was a silly scene it did act as a foundation for the relationship they would later develop . <p> Part 2 <p> Classic Discord chaos ! He sure does like floating buildings , does n't he ? The beginning of part 2 was an excellent show of how powerful and dangerous Discord was and as our heroes started to enter the lowest point of the two parter things really looked truly , truly screwed . <p> And the memes continue ! Ever wonder where Tom came from ? Well , it was this episode that Boulder 's potential boyfriend was born and has continued as a theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also helped solidify the term coined from the previous episode : Flutterb**** . Quite a popular meme in the day and I believe personally helped kick off the idea of branching out Fluttershy 's personality in fan works past the shy , sweet Fluttershy we knew at the time . <p> Congratulations Spike , you 're the new Rainbow Dash ! Lots of colorful Spikes after this episode . <p> We finally hit our lowest point in the episode and while most episodes of MLP can be somewhat predictable I think at the time no one knew how the heroes would resolve conflict before them . A scary prospect since our girls had conquered every challenge they faced up to this point . <p> It was also at this point we spotted Screwball , a character that would endure in the fandom for many seasons to come and played a prominent role in song Daddy Discord ! <p> Near the end of the episode we received quite a surprise as the letters from season 1 became an important plot point , turning them from a moral delivery device in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her friends . It was a clever use of the letters , revealing an arc we did n't really know about through season 1 . So well done ! <p> I do n't know if I 'm the only one , but remember a time when Twilight 's magic seemed a bit more surprising ? We were still learning about her and her abilities at the time so that plays a large part in it but she seems a bit toned down in recent seasons , with a lot of teleporting and horn lasers making up her basic magic nowadays . <p> Ah , back in the day when nuking your enemies with rainbows was the most effective means of subduing them . More importantly it was at this point where Discord was once again turned to stone that we wondered if we 'd ever see him again which we were happily proven wrong sometime later . Also , probably one of the most hardcore ways the girls defeated an enemy . Besides blowing up Sombra , trapping someone in stone for apparently all eternity is pretty hardcore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end ? References have always been a part of MLP but they seemed farther in-between in earlier seasons . Now it seems like we have a new reference in almost every episodes . Cool little easter eggs , but they seemed to have a bigger impact back then . Now whether it was because it was amazing seeing references like this in a MLP show back then and the surprise has worn off or the more frequent references have diluted the surprise a bit I 'm not sure . <p> **38;213;TOOLONG <p> Well guys , I hope you enjoyed my little recap ! I do n't do these often but it was fun going back to watch an episode I have n't seen in years . Now relive the magic of The Return of Harmony down below . 
@@77555979 @6255979/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> The folks here at Equestria Daily invited me to become a contributor for comic book reviews . How about we start things off with Siege of the Crystal Empire ? The Trade Paperback Book just hit store shelves today . <p> Be warned , there are spoilers after the break ! <p> Now I am the prettiest princess ! <p> Siege of the Crystal Empire takes many of the lingering threads from King Sombras Fiendship is Magic issue and weaves them into a new story . Sombras childhood friend , Radiant Hope , returns to Equestria after a millennia-long absence . Her motives are unclear but the first goal is to gain entrance to the Crystal Empires castle . To do this , she recruits the aid of <p> These narrow-minded neer-do-wells disrupt the Crystal Faire preparations and swipe the Crystal Heart , leaving the Empire open to invasion by Queen Chrysalis and her Changelings . All this offers Radiant Hope the chance to sneak in and restore the fragmented King Sombra . And this time , he has a vocabulary . <p> From there the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the crossfire , and the growing threat the Umbrum horde . Many key plot points feature characters making mistakes in haste or anger . If you 're looking for an Aesop element , the fallout from these poor decisions is good material . Such as Twilight lashing out at a critical moment , almost dooming Equestria . <p> The core of this story focuses not upon the Mane Six or even the princesses , but rather on Sombras choice between Radiant Hopes encouragement and the Crystal Heart 's prophecy . Is he the monster everyone thought or can he choose his own destiny ? <p> Radiant Hope acts as Sombra 's conscience , na+ve but loving . She above all characters determines the readers reactions to this story . Despite her attempts to guide Sombra , her own actions are , at best , morally questionable . She maintains that the imprisoned Umbrum are victims of the Crystal Ponies ' prejudice . This would be an interesting conflict if not for the My Little Pony title . We know how this world works . Though the ponies err , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure evil . This is a more cut-and-dry , right-and-wrong world . I would have found such a concept fascinating . Its part of why I am a Radiant Hope fan , though I understand why she 's drawn much scorn . Even the comic 's villains taunt her intelligence . <p> The conflict is beautifully illustrated by Andy Price . Special props to any scenes involving Sombras shadow form or the Umbrums nightmare appearances . Characters remain expressive and dynamic . Just study a panel where Cadance realizes she may have rage in her heart . Her stare speaks volumes . <p> Yet if there 's one thing IDWs 4-part arcs consistently try , its putting too many players in too small a space . We have at least seventeen named characters featured , with two armies of supporting cast near the end . Reading through it all , I wonder if the story would have been strengthened by reducing the roster . <p> The LNQEBNVNE are active antagonists for the first half of the story , only to reconsider their actions when its too late to change . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no resolution . We are left to assume that they are now fugitives . How fitting that the group 's final words are , " What will Iron Will do now ? " <p> By contrast , Princess Cadance does not become proactive until the second half , having hidden from the conflict . She is brave and quick-witted in her single chapter to shine , but compared to Luna and Celestias expanded roles in the Nightmare Rarity and Reflections arcs , it seems she 's been shortchanged . Shining Jobber has it far worse , as his role is to be battered around by the villains and used as a bargaining chip . Similar fates for Celestia and Luna . <p> Also , Princess Luna , see me after class ! <p> The Mane Six are present , but have little impact on the story besides leading hijinks-filled combat . This might sound fun since many comic antagonists are defeated in similar battles , but those same characters behaved like buffoons throughout their stories . This comic asks that the audience fear the Umbrum . A goofy brawl is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are only five key characters . Sombra , whose decisions will shape the future . Radiant Hope and Rabia the Umbrum , who pull Sombra in two directions . Last but not least , Cadance and Twilight Sparkle . They know the most about Sombra and Radiant Hopes history and act as Equestrias defenders . Focusing the cast to these critical players would allow the story room to breath . That in turn could offer the audience the chance to empathize with Radiant Hope and allow Twilight and Cadance to consider their actions ' impact . <p> As it is , this story brings forth enjoyable ideas and questions about characters we assume we know . It treats Sombra with much more investment than the show . Yet each strength carries a shadow . The story is so over-ripe with characters that nothing can develop . The rushed pace keeps the tension , but with much less payoff . <p> I 'd encourage folks to give this a read for the alternate interpretation of Sombra and to view characters like Cadance in a different light . That comes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ending might not match anticipation . <p> And whatever did happen to our lesser antagonists ? <p> In MLP# 3436 , four beings committed crimes for which they were never tried . <p> Now fugitives from Equestrian justice , they live as soldiers of fortune . <p> Because reasons . If you have a scheme , if you need lackeys , <p> and if you can figure out their motivations , then maybe you can hireThe LNQEBNVNE ! 
@@77555982 @6255982/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> Our followup schedule got a tad messed up , so I return once again for this one . Hopefully Starlight Glimmer was up to your exceedingly difficult to please standards last time fandom . I try ! I really do ! We all do ! <p> Since this was another one of those episodes light on references but great on character interaction , I 'll probably get opiniony again . I have a lot of those . Six years in the pony trenches will do that to a man .

It corrupted my short term memory beyond repair ) <p> Anyway , go get your followup below ! <p> I keep complaining about Twilight , and she has changed a lot since growing wings and maturing over the seasons , but she still has plenty of old Twilight moments .

Why do cats do that ? Just more proof that dogs are better I went there . <p> Just in case you ever worried about how pony lips worked . I know a lot of you have thought about it based on those polls , do n't lie . <p> I do n't want to offend anyon ... oh <p> More throwback , it looks like all that money from Rarity 's new dress business expansion upgraded her fainting couch . The old one was much less extravagant . <p> Let 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pirate is . <p> Temporary Opiniony Serious mode <p> Since everyone seemed to enjoy the last time I dropped some serious , I 'll do it again ! I 've been told a lot over the years that I give off an air of dislike for Apples here . I think it really all just stems from where I was raised . Here in Arizona , you ca n't go 5 feet without running into cowboy junk . We have entire stores dedicated to boots and hats . The trope is draining after years of being bombarded with it . The amount of times I 've heard horrible things spouted out of people that embrace said lifestyle is kinda terrifying . The insane amount of times I 've seen completely logical and amazing plans collapse for the sake of tradition makes me die a little inside . <p> Early Applejack was really just stuck in that cookie cutter build . Thankfully she has become much less one-dimensional as the episodes go on . It kind of reminds me of people 's hate for Glimmer after yesterday 's editorial . Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , but back in the day an Applejack episode was largely met with groans in the exact same way . The writing style portrayed in the show has a very slow growth curve , with many a repeated character storyline until they strike gold and expand them a bit . If you open your mind and try to put some of that blind dislike for a specific character behind you , all the ponies in the mane cast eventually grow on you . Apples here is the perfect example for me . Even if her initial offering was everything I 'd grown up through life hating , the rest of her character shown from season three onward has made her a pony I love seeing . <p> Sure she has her frustrating moments ( including a couple this season ) , but everypony does . They do still have somewhat templated personalities that the newer writers fall back on every once in a while to an extreme degree ( again , this season especially for Apples ) . I appreciate her for all the other amazing moments she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a few times over the years that she needs more episodes not focused on apples and family , but I forget that her entire livelihood is apples and family . Would I be able to go a day without anything at all involving pony ? Probably not . We 've got common ground in that we both love what we do , but also ca n't really do many other things because it 's so time consuming . I would n't call it trapped , just too busy . <p> That being said , the Applejack of this episode is the Applejack I love , not just because she makes an amazing pirate , but because she showed a side we rarely get to see ; the adventurer ! The type of job that would require getting dirty , tackling difficult situations , and the courageousness she has in spades . I feel like she is always at her best when she is n't on the farm . Even fixing up the Ponyville spa was a neat characterization touch ( though the rest of that episode was ... something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Applejack adventure arc ! This entire episode got me excited for some ship traveling , danger facing , treasure finding goodness . Sure I can get it elsewhere plenty , but not with these amazing ponies heading it . They really do make everything better . <p> Just look at how well these guys at DHX animate a stormy ocean . The art style with it 's wispy clouds and heavy line usage works so well in an environment like that , and the cute pony models add a contrast that makes the entire thing unique . Hasbro why do we only have one pony series ? ! Does n't transformers get a million spinoffs ? Take my bits ! Serious Mode Over <p> In normal cartoons , this would just be cartoon physics . In pony , this could be a legit Bag of Holding . That 's one thing I 've always loved about the show . The Dungeons and Dragons geek in me is CONSTANTLY ready for more . If you have no idea what that is , consider yourself an uncultured swine . <p> How does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? I googled it . They may not be able to regurgitate like us , but they can definitely have too much sugar . <p> MFW out to eat with someone who is on a " Eliminate everything tasty " diet MFW it 's their 20th Hollywood diet this year and nothing has changed . MFW they follow up their weekly torture with a 5000 calorie weekend cheat day . <p> MFW they bitch about my cheeseburger and how unhealthy and fattening it is . <p> Or just be a cartoon pony . Apparently candy and ice cream is the equivalent to salad over there . <p> Small Reference : Rarity 's outfit is parodying someone named Charles Nelson , a famous treasure hunter . Albeit with a few more gemstones . <p> And much better looking <p> One thing I love about this episode is the strange , exaggerated way each of the ponies seems to mentally represent one another . Even if their stories were supposed to be " fishermen 's tales " where everything is blown out of proportion , they still kinda show what , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's army of stallions and piles of materialistic items is kinda telling on what she truly believes of Rarity . You only get this kind of truth when you are angry about someone ! After their differences in Spice Up Your Life , It 's not that big a stretch at all to think Pinkie sees Rarity this way . <p> Applejack 's retelling is probably the most interesting here though when looking at it from that angle . Does she really see Pinkie Pie like this ? I actually dove into a few old scenes to get a view on how she usually reacts to party horse in other episodes . Surprisingly , out of all the mane 6 , she really does seem to be the least enthusiastic about Pinkie 's randomness . <p> This type of reaction happens almost every time the two of them are in the same scene together , even when other ponies are laughing at her antics . Try digging around some time . It really is fascinating . <p> That being said , these two are goddamn adorable . <p> I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouts " darling " and complex words is her normal way of seeing her . Even I would probably use that if I ever had to describe her to someone . <p> I 'd also say she looks really good in proper oldschool New York gangster garb . <p> Apparently its supposed to be a titanic reference . <p> In other news , I think this vector artist forgot a hoof . <p> " How do I make it look like an accident ? " <p> I was going to say something about explosive ... something based on that volcano on it 's butt , but I did n't want to be a dick to the poor guy . <p> Either these ponies are incredibly well off ( and I 'm assuming Twilight and Rarity are ) , or this giant box of ancient sunken treasure is n't worth anything at all in Equestria , as they did n't even seem the slightest bit excited after opening it . <p> I have to admit , the ending was a bit odd . There were a lot of consistencies between their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance traveled from shore and humongous storm . Were they really just a few feet off the docks the entire time ? Do pony memories just work on a completely different space/time scale than ours ? <p> Despite that , I actually really liked this one . The " ponies on a ship/in the ocean " trope is LONG overdue and something I 've been craving for ages . We got it briefly in the comics , but I 'd kill for some more high-seas adventure in the actual show . The team over at DHX absolutely nailed the seafaring vibe , with everything from the background music to the outfits and environment . I really hope it 's something we can do more of in the future . <p> And with that I 'm out ! Sorry about the lack of jokeyness . Hopefully the other followupers will be around for the bombardment we are getting later this week if those UK schedules do n't change .

@@77555987 @6255987/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> We 've gone over the individual parts , so how about a look at the overall story to the most recent three-part arc ? Check out the review and sound off in the comments after the break ! <p> When the previews came out and stated our lead heroines would go bad , I was worried . Plenty of stories have dealt with the concept of a champion falling into selfishness or hate . Yet the weaker versions have always featured that change being forced upon the character . Brainwashing , corruption , some force that 's to blame so the character remains untarnished no matter what happens.If a character goes bad , it can serve as a cautionary tale . This comic likes to emphasize Luna 's tragic past , conveniently forgetting the Nightmare Rarity arc 's take . While a blow to my beloved continuity , I 'm glad they left that out . I never liked the idea that Nightmare Moon is a mind parasite , and Luna 's fall should be the result of her own poor choices and attitude . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupted hot spring is the opposite . No matter what happens , it 's not really their fault . To this comic 's credit , it started out tackling the idea in a believable way . The Mane Six did n't just start cackling and swearing allegiance to the dark forces . They knew what they were good at and stopped caring about others . Instead of asking how they could help , it 's about what they are owed . <p> Apologies to the Nostalgia Critic . I could have passed this up , but chose not to . <p> This is where Tony Fleecs and Heather Breckel 's contributions shine . Throughout the story , their work on the characters and backgrounds makes it a visual treat . We see so many locals and action scenes , each rendered beautifully . In a lot of ways I view this story like a summer blockbuster . Big visuals , big fights , a lot of spectacle . <p> Do n't know what she 's upset about . This is a typical Ponyville Tuesday . <p> That 's not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it becomes too cramped for a three-issue arc . The Evil Six start off as comical villains . Over-reacting , posturing , but causing little damage . During a chase scene , Spike notes that Applejack is getting worse , and indeed by the second issue we see the Evil Six assaulting ponies and damaging property . The most action-packed scene being Pinkie raining down corrupting water balloons.Yet it 's during the height of this action that the story starts to lose focus . There have been consistent themes . No matter what her mental state , Pinkie insists in each issue that comedy is based on surprise , setting up for her outwitting Twilight . The Evil Six increase their aggression as they begin to overlap and get in one another 's way . The water is apparently growing stronger as well , since ponies struck by a water balloon instantly become selfish . There is a clear escalation , culminating with Nightmare Moon 's return . <p> Nightmare Moon , however , becomes the story 's unraveling . It 's not just the question of why Luna transformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach . Nightmare Moon claims to have been freed from Luna 's shell , as if they are indeed separate beings . She says she 's been a part of the darker side for centuries . Twilight later declares that Nightmare Moon was Luna 's " better " self . But why ? What 's the appeal ? The only answer I can think of is " because she 's evil " . So now our heroines really are cackling and saying how much they love being evil.Applejack was my favorite villainous interaction . Not because of action or menace . See Fluttershy and Rarity for that . No , Applejack was interesting because she acknowledged how she used to be and claimed she was better . No mention of evil or world domination . She just felt liberated and focused . There is the argument that giving care and attention to others might distract from our own personal achievements . One aspect that is n't explored is how empty that accomplishment can feel if one reaches it alone.Here I am , talking about the Evil Six . What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think this was her strongest showing . Awesome entrances aside . <p> So awesome ! <p> Luna is the magical muscle . The force that goes up against the enhanced Evil Six and often gets thrown around to show their menace . Very little of her interactions go beyond a fight , though her dialog with Rarity did hint that Luna 's greatest fear is being obsolete . I find it sad that Twilight was able to predict Celestia would send Luna . Has Equestria 's sovereign grown so dependent on others that she wo n't directly intervene to save her friends ? <p> Or put you in the cross-hairs of a psycho pony with evil water balloons . <p> But maybe I 'm overthinking it . <p> Zecora is much as she 's become in the show . I do n't doubt her wisdom , but her insight seems forced . She knows the answer right away , without trial and error . The odd thing is that this does n't make her look smarter . Much like when she had that time-viewing alicorn potion in Princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less a real character and more a plot point . <p> I also realize I just typed the words " time-viewing alicorn potion " . This franchise does weird things to people.The protagonists I really cheer for are Spike and the Cutie Mark Crusaders . They have n't Zecora 's knowledge or Luna 's power , but they accomplish much . The CMC in particular run into several dangerous scenarios and show they 've got impressive running skills . Yet this power difference makes them more sympathetic . It also adds to their success when they manage to out-think their sisters and restore them . Spike is likewise sincere and proactive , though his contribution is more about his dragon biology than his own virtue . <p> The downside for the Crusaders is the lack of impact these events hold . While the fillies react with proper fear or confusion , they never seem to register what 's happening . Their big sisters no longer love them . The family they knew might be gone for good . Nothing seems to hurt or worry them beyond the immediate , physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact if we 'd seen the positive ponies register what could be lost . Of course we must discuss the ending . An invading animal army , a corrupted alicorn set loose , and a second plotting every outcome . There was so much at play with rising stakes , and it all ends with a rainstorm and water bucket . Given the progression , this feels like a letdown . I wonder how this might have played out with one more issue . Could we have seen the animals invade while Nightmare Moon , Twilight , and Rarity battled for dominance ? Could the staff have taken it to an action-packed extreme ? Given some of the darker humor or events we 've seen in the past , I have a hard time believing they shied away just because this is a kid 's comic . <p> My favorite fight of the comic . <p> The fact that it is aimed at the young makes the theme of good and evil more important . In some ways , this story works to show altruism vs selfishness . As Luna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd worked together . The physically weaker individual ponies banded together to win , so I think you can mark that as a positive message.When the story goes in to flat-out " evil " , that moral becomes lost . No matter how cruel the acts , people do n't do something just because it 's evil . They justify the action . They try to force it to make sense . To the individual , it seems like they 're doing what 's right for them . Telling kids that someone is doing something because they 're evil sends the wrong message . There 's no caution to watch out for our own vices because we tell ourselves that we could never be pure evil like those villains.My favorite villains are the ones that make us realize how easy it is to slip into selfishness . How their cruel actions can make sense . How we 're all just one bad day away from ... <p> So weighing all the good and the bad , I think this is a fun story , but not an insightful one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can accept a rushed ending . It 's always fun to see Luna and the CMC carried themselves well . Yet the running joke of Tony Fleecs and Tom Zahler 's OC 's debating philosophy highlights that the idea for a look at selfishness and cruelty is there , but never fully explored .

For those of you not in the know , we at River Horse have been working our hooves to the bone to bring MLP and traditional roleplay gaming ( RPGs ) together ( MLPRPG or Milerperpegeh ) and its been a blast ! I thought I would take this moment to talk a little about the cover , a hugely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into the cover ? <p> We knew pretty early on what we wanted out of the cover , we wanted to show anyone who looked at it what they would be getting when they opened the book , that is to say ponies and adventure ! Working with the fantastic Amy Mebberson , we decided that catching an adventuring party halfway through their travels would give the best impression . So it went that we created a party , following the classic three person fighter/wizard/rogue set up that is such a staple in traditional roleplaying games . My little pony is a fantastic introduction to roleplaying games partly because of its vibrant world and varied species which meant we could show the magical unicorns , strong earth ponies and speedy pegasi in an instant and people would immediately identify with the archetypal party we made . After that it was a matter of placing them in an adventure ( navigating through the Everfree forest ! ) and the rest fell into place .

@@77555999 @6255999/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> WeAreBorg finally here with some of the first Guardians of Harmony toys hitting US shelves . Today I am reviewing the its-not-creepy Shining Armor and the abandon-all-your-friends Shadowbolt . <p> Join me below for a trip inside the box full of spice , dragons , stop motion , and literally anything else . <p> So before you start asking why these ones first , I 'll let you know these were the first two that arrived in the mail . I think its great because while doing this review , I 've thought up what I want to with some of the more anticipated GoH toys . Anyway , enough of my rambling , let 's grab a camera and a lint roller and play with some toys ! <p> Toys in boxes . What did you expect ? <p> Okay , so I cant tell you guys just how excited I was to finally get these in . Cynder taunted me with them for hours . Right away we can see the similarities with the Fan Serie : The character in the corner , name in white outlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Packaging is also clear and the toys are posed so if you 're a collector who wants to keep the packaging , these guys wo n't suffer for it . Oddly the say " Shadowbolts " as in more than one as if the cockatrice was one too . Not quite the case is it . Speaking of unisex action figures and cockatrices , not sure all the boys out needed another excuse to emphasize the first syllable of an innocent word to make his friends giggle . Let 's spin them round ... <p> " Shadowbolts Pony &amp; Green Chicken " <p> Like the Fan Series , these have a picture of the toy on the back ... that 's technically smaller than real life , but hey it shows you that it moves . Also , it confirms what the little badges are . They are in fact badges for you to represent just how into toys you are . Naturally , I wear all of mine all the time . Well get to those in a bit . Also , can you say first MLP toy weapon ? An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a person who has one of every toy , the first weapon is a big deal to me , as a collector . Let 's destroy the collectors value and open these up ... <p> More accessories than my Roomba . <p> BBBFF comes with body armor and helm , spear , shield , and badge . All the makings of a warrior . Shady , that 's her name , comes with goggles , chicken , badge , silver lightning bolt and a purple spandex outfit that she needs your help getting into . Just kidding . Her hair is more awesome than Shinys though . The chicken is n't doing it for me , though , honestly I 'd say the same thing if they packaged Scootaloo with Rainbow Dash . Its funny that they thought it necessary to pair a Shadowbolt with a cockatrice as if a Shadowbolt was n't cool enough . I would have liked to see a pairing of both a female and male Shadowbolt just like the Wonderbolt set . I would have ordered that from Amazon in a heartbeat then the shipping would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generator ... <p> Shiny is naked ... <p> So let 's get into the number one unique feature about this toy line . These guys are posable . And not just a little but like a lot posable . I 'll attempt a demonstration later , but for now , I 'll try to explain in words . Forelegs are capable of the widest range of movements including 360 rotation at the shoulder and knee as well as about 90 degrees of bend at the shoulder and knee . Rear legs have simple 360 pivots . The tails and wings are on ball joints which means a large degree of motion in all direction and the ability to rotate . The heads can tilt forward till it 's level with the ground and can rotate a full 360 if you 'd like to reenact an exorcism . The joints are stiff enough to hold their position and there are less manufacturing imperfections than the Fan Series figures.There 's a lot of potential in these toys and the balance is great . Now that I 've thought about it , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morphed form that is Nightmare Moon , then this is really a naked third of Luna . The best third cause it 's the female third . Let 's slap some clothes on ' em ... <p> No 360 of green chicken for you . <p> So a bit about the accessories now that I 'm showing them off . The helm and armor for Shining are a softer plastic than the ponies that makes fitting the pieces onto the stallion pretty easy . On the downside , however , the clasp for the armor against his chest is rather touchy and rarely stays together . It 's so soft that it 's hard to mash the tab into the hole while it 's on him . Attaching the spear and shield , also soft but not too soft , was natural . On Shady McShadyface , the glasses clip below the ear but with less than gentle handling , will slide down and off her face . If you look closely you 'll see that the goggles are actually a little transparent which just goes to show the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd . Maybe she 'll play Zeus in God of War . Shining can be Kratos . We 'll explore that later . For now , let 's compare them to other toys ... <p> Guess which one the dog chewed on . <p> So they 're almost the size of the common brushable , just a little bigger and wider . See Shadowbolt Rainbow Dash there for instance . Now the Shining punk rocker brushable there is a kinda fluke . He 's much bigger than he should be compared to a Twilight or Cadence brushable and as such he stands about a half an inch taller than GoH shining armor . In the middle is blind bag BBBFF , also pretty big . I was super proud of this shot by the way , with him standing with his gear . He 's actually supporting all his weight on his hind legs in an easily obtainable balance while the shield and spear rest against him . If you do n't recognize the Celestia in the back by now then where have you been ? Let 's back peddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll front page you if you get one of these tattooed <p> I can only assume these are to allow fans to immerse themselves in the action . It 'll be interesting to see if badges have any part in the IDW spin off comic . A simple sticker on a simple mold . They have a little flapper to clip onto clothes , buttons , or noses . Let 's try it out ... <p> You will never kiss these lips <p> I told you they would attach to noses . Quite securely in fact . I think it 's a bold a fashion that let 's people know what you 're about . I bet by the next con I go to everyone will be wearing one . But I mustache you a question . Does this count as a shining armor cosplay ? Anyway , back to the ponies . Let 's check out that balance some more ... <p> Lean , mean bucking machine . <p> I like any toy that can stand in place long enough for me to jack with my camera . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even one hoof is easy . For now , let 's go with the bucking pose instead of a break dancing one . That 's for later . He could be bucking all sorts of things ! I 'm spoiled for choice . Let 's go to the fridge ... <p> What your face would look like if Shiny bucked it <p> Okay , so the fridge did n't have any apples . I did n't notice that was a bell pepper and not an apple until after I had grabbed it from the drawer and tossed it on the table . It was red alright . Oh ! I do have an apple for him to buck , hold on ... <p> To the moon ! <p> Apple bucking goodness ! These toys are fun for all ages ! I thought I 'd spare you more Scootabuse . I wish I had a Diamond Tiara really . Anyway , enough of Shining 's powerful flanks , we 'll move on to the bad girl . Let 's take the balance to the next level , really stretch those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... <p> Sweet Celestia forgive me <p> Okay , other than being absolutely terrifying , this animation proves I suck green chickens at stop motion . It was n't easy moving the limbs without tossing her on her side . I may have thrown a tantrum at one point in frustration and Cynder told me to go to my room and to not treat my toys like the target demographic . I said " Who are you , my mom ? " and she replied , " No , our last cosplay together was Shining and Twilight . " It 's not creepy . Also , that was at Nightmare Nights . Shout out to those who went to the EQD panel ! Anyway , the idea of multiple toys is to play with them as a set . Let 's try it out ... <p> Is this politically correct ? <p> Too much fun ! Shining Armor is really just a hard dude . He 's seen and done things that do n't just fall in the gray areas but move the boundaries altogether . He is the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragon . We 'll get to that later . So this is what happens when your toys come with spears . The battles commence , the imagination soars and the wings pop out ... <p> She 's actually an earth pony . <p> I think I saw a performance like this in college . Really deep stuff . Holding the keys to your success , your strength , your inner being , but not being able to use them . I think there 's a fanfic about this but with Rainbow Dash . Also , this could be a Starlight Glimmer mindset taken to the extreme . A true defiance of the Equestrian Pony magic by ripping out the main conduit for Pegasi magic , the wings , and displaying them with unwavering resolve . Dark stuff . Scootaloo would be a likely candidate for such a cult . Speaking of Scootaloo , let 's check out that other " Shadowbolt " ... <p> Already petrified . <p> I 'm not a huge fan of the cockatrice but it 's still pretty fun that they included it . Now you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one else likes , such as Twilight forever being encased in stone , Fluttershy giving her life to save the CMC , Equestria falling to Tirek , Luna failing to ... I ... I 'll move on . Anyway , let 's explore another one of the possibilities of owning both sets ... <p> 20-inch shields on my tail ridin ' <p> Shining Armor looks pretty gangsta . I just now figured out why Twilight is so nerdy . No Colt would have been stupid enough to talk to her with a big brother like that . You stunted her socialization Shining . It was all you . So bad at friendship that she turned into a Princess of it . If only that work in real life . Like in the bedroom . Oh , right , politically correct . Hasbro will never speak to me after this . Maybe if I endorse one of their games ... <p> Carefree hacked . <p> Man , I hope you get the reference because that took effort . Can Rarity be quick enough to grab the cloud and dodge Shady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Star level-up racing game was not my favorite part of the Gameloft game . I more enjoyed evenly distributing my buildings and digging up roots and builders . But back to the toys . The secret to a good toy is one that will mesh with your existing toys , and the GoH figures defiantly do that . Let 's try some more meshing ... <p> This is definitely creepy . <p> Anthro Equestria Girls Twilight majestically riding into battle aboard her noble brother . There is so much wrong with that statement . Speaking of wrong , Twilight also has a soft plastic clasp that holds her skirt on like Shining 's armor . It just would not stay on for this picture . I was fighting to clothe her and Cynder walked in and gave me this dirty look and hit me in the back of the head . Such injustice . If I wanted my articles to get heated and spicy I would do this ... <p> Senor Pepper . <p> Like all I have in my kitchen are various peppers apparently . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All in all these toys are fun and the quality is great . I had a great deal of fun playing with them and writing this review . My niece came over after my shoot and started playing with these specifically and greatly enjoyed them . If you like figures you can set up and leave in a scene or you want to actively play with them , and even if you want to leave them in the packaging , the Guardians of Harmony line is for you .

While Guardians of Harmony has been trademarked for use as " Toy ponies and accessories for use therewith " earlier this year , this new trademark is specifically for " Entertainment services , namely , an on-going animated television series for children " Could be Hasbro just covering all its trademark bases , but as our submitter pointed out Equestria Girls eventually got the same trademark and was turned into an animated series .

Yet here we are , in 2016 , and it 's happening . <p> I 'm not going to dive too deep into the politics here , but a brief summary should get you all caught up on what is currently exploding just about everywhere .

@@77556016 @6256016/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> Behold , you pathetic foals ! The dark alicorn of the Night has returned to rule this world and its subjects ; all the ponies of ... this place . Unleashed unto this realm as the greatest , and most anticipated My Little Pony toy ever created , we vow to make the Night last forever ! <p> Join me below the horizon to see the beginning of the end , her journey into this world , her conquest of the nightlife , and of the glory of Nightmare Moon ! <p> UPDATE header changed by popular lols ! ! <p> Being sent to Borg 's house is worse than the moon . <p> Here she is ; imprisoned no doubt by her sister in this not-very-moon-shaped box . Similar in all ways to the other Guardians of Harmony : Fan Series cardboard entrapment devices , Nightmare Moons sports an image of herself with the most apple eating grin she 's ever had . Her palette and that of the background , the debris and desecration that is the Castle of the Royal Sisters , blend well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before releasing her , let us take a moment to survey the rest of her current tomb ... <p> Resting evil face . <p> One side of the box sports the face of one who is completely in control , a ruler to her subjects . On the back and adjacent side , better photographs than what I 'm taking here , show her true furious glory ! Such as the box belonging to that scourge Celestia , the Darks Queens box shows her pose is also taken from episode 2 of season 1 . While she could be paired with Celestia in some unseen battle behind the scenes as soon as she was released , which would also explain Celestias sudden disappearance , her pose is best reflected in this screenshot when facing Twilight ... <p> " I ca n't believe you ate that . " <p> Yes . Magnificent . If you notice , the Mare in the Moon is very much like her onscreen counterpart . The show accuracy is amazing . With a few small tweaks like fleshing out the feathers on the wings and shrinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that very first day on October 10th , 2010 . Keep coming back to this image as we admire the physical form of the alicorn of the Night further .... <p> She 'll rule your display lighting . <p> The similarities with rest of the Fan Series figures continues with an ambient/display light window on top of the cardboard shrine . Here , the left shot represents Nightmare Moon placed on a dark shelf where she feels most at home , and the right , better shows off her angry scowl as Celestials sun pours down around her . I would be careful of which display option you choose to use on your own Princess . Let us finally release her . <p> Looks just like the box unlike that Cheesy Velveeta Skillet . <p> Newly awoken , Nightmare Moon unsurprisingly looks better than her box art , unlike her so-called sister Celestias box art that needed fancy lighting to set the mood . I have set out a black pseudo nightscape for her to be displayed upon henceforth , and totally not just a black sheet I needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Preposterous ! Without further ado , I give you the 360 of Nightmare Moon . <p> A model rotation of the Moon . <p> Yeah , you 've been staring at that for 10 loops now . I know you have , do n't  lie . There is a lot of beauty on this alicorn , just like its found in the night sky . Perfect choices like the best shade of sparkly purple for the mane and tail , combined with subtle details such as the blue outline on the underside of her feathers , make this an all around amazing piece . Unlike Celestia , the Nightmare Moon has cutie marks on both sides and is designed to be displayed from any angle . If you get the whole fan Series set you 'll feel as though different artists created each figure , and Nightmare Moon got the better end of the bargain . Risking the wrath of the Moon Princess , I will say however that there were a number of imperfections on this particular figure both at the mold injection points , like the one right under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residue in some very random spots making them appear shiny . Since Nightmare Moon is so dark , such imperfections are hardly noticed on her and would be more so on say , Celestia . That is just the picky collector side of me talking but the Lunar worshiper side of me says we must compare the Dark alicorn with older effigies ... <p> Mirror Pool Luna and see what happens . <p> So many alicorns of the Night ! Compared to herself , the Guardians of Harmony : Fan Series Nightmare Moon is one of the largest molded figures of the Princess . Even the Funko vinyl Luna is n't quite as tall , though it may be a bit heavier . Also in the shot is a fan created indiegogo Luna plush , and the Aurora World season 1 Luna . At her feet , the first NMM blindbag , the Funko Mystery Mini NMM and Luna , who is on top of the large Funko vinyl . Next to that , is the new blindbag sized Princess Luna part of the new Friendship is Magic collection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an enormous Princess Luna by Equestria Plush which you may recognize as a background in many of my shots . Missing from the picture is the lets-fly-to-the-castle , talking , brushable Nightmare Moon who stands a few inches taller . While plushies will always be bigger , if display size is your thing , then this new Princess of the Night is the way to go . When ones looking in a mirror , one will always look good . Let us see how our mighty Princess faces off against her sister ... <p> The greatest of all sibling rivalries . <p> Now the balance is tilted ! The white balance that is . Celestia , the ruiner of everything , is ruining my shot . No matter , the better sister shall prevail . Small differences between the pair suggest that different artists did create each piece . Celestia has a very angled face with sharp edges and cheekbones , while the dark sister has a traditional round pony head . Celestias armor sticks out from her body while NMMs is just slightly raised . Even the eyelashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celestias figure is really just meant to be viewed from the one angle as suggested by the single Cutie Mark , and the limited wing movement compared to Nightmare Moons ... <p> Flappy , flappy . <p> Like the Fan Series Discord , Nightmare Moon has very functional ball joints for her wings that allow for a wide range of movements . This makes her posing in your home while she rules over you , perfect in everyway a Princess can be . And speaking of wings , Nightmare Moon has grown bored of this fawning over and wishes to see her new subjects in this world . Come , then mortals , and journey with us as the dark alicorn explores her new kingdom . <p> At her request , she first wants to visit the ponies of this land <p> Here , Nightmare Moon is about to conquer the guardian of the ponies of this land . Harmony can not last here ! On to the ponies ! <p> She is shocked and confused by this enormous pony ! Truly there must be something wrong with the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his rightful ruler . The Dark Princess will put his strong back to work building her new castle . <p> This mare will soon feel the wrath of the Night if she does not show the proper respect ! There is too much smelling of the Dark Alicorn ! <p> There is something wrong about the ponies of this world . Maybe they are more like Saddle Arabians . Regardless , they will obey ! <p> Gah ! You insolent foal ! How dare you try to taste the Princess of the Night ! You will learn to fear the Mare in the Moon . Remember this day , my **44;288;TOOLONG pony , for it will be your last ! <p> Remember this day for it was your last . The night will last forever ! <p> Not satisfied with the equine subjects she had encountered , she had the wonderous idea to see how the other subjects of the realm embraced her eternal night . She journeyed to the brightest glow in the sky to find herself in the middle of a bustle of activity . Here the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ; partaking of drink , food , dancing , and merriment ! Truly , these are are her subjects and here she shall rule the night ! <p> The first of many meetings this night . These lovely mares complimented The Dark Princess of the night on her amazing mane and spoke of the fun that her night holds ! These is hope for this world yet ! <p> Moving to another table , the alicorn of the Night found more citizens who enjoyed the night the she brings forth . They plan for many hours of celebration ahead ! <p> Shortly the peons who wished to find themselves in the graces of Nightmare Moon offered up the drink of her homeland : apple cider . The Dark One , however , is displeased at the lack of thought to bring her a straw ! <p> These bartenders , craftsmen of the ancient art , served many quality drinks to the Alicorn of the Moon . They have pledged to pursue the acquisition of glassware that is more fang friendly . <p> The darkest one gifts her followers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nightmare though she does not show it on her face . <p> Here is one of this worlds Lunar Guards , here to protect this establishment from harm and keep out those foals who are unworthy to yet partake in this most glorious of celebrations . <p> Nightmare Moon is unsure of this nations flag colors and will mostly likely change them once she has asserted her dominance on the governments of this world . For now , though , she is happy to procure more elixirs for her growing legions of humans that have sworn allegiance to her . <p> There is still so many mares and stallions of this world to meet who will swear their allegiance to the Night . This barkeep swears there are many star themed concoctions in the works . <p> Many enjoy this night without the aid of friendship lubricant . This mare enjoys the evening with her best friend and good music . <p> In this moment , the Alicorn of the Stars commanded the creation of a drink of the Sun.so that it might be consumed ! MUhahahahahahaha . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and celebrate with Nightmare Moon . Her reign of the Night with be without equal ! <p> These citizens of the twilight led the Dark One to a food establishment on wheels . Wheels are round like the Moon and please the alicorn . <p> Here the magic of salsa was applied to tacos which excited the palette of the Night Princess . With a full belly and many memories , Nightmare Moon adjourned to prepare for the conquering of this world . <p> She the greatest princess and a fair sovereign to her subject but be warned , should she find you not celebrating her Night at the moment of her dominions rise , she will be most cross with you ! <p> Final verdict : If you only ever buy one My Little Pony toy , buy this one .

@@77556020 @6256020/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> WeAreBorg back again with my second ever merch review . Yall liked the first enough that I plan on continuing these reviews regularly . As you can see , this time around I have some of the hottest toys hitting online shelves right now-Guardians of Harmony : Fan Series Discord and Celestia . I was supposed to have gotten Nightmare Moon as well , but Sunbutt managed to banish her UPS box to another zipcode , so well see her later on . <p> Join me below for big toys , chocolate milk , and some serious scowls . <p> Guardians of Harmony Fan Series <p> Discord <p> Imprisoned for a 1000 hours <p> So the Guardians of Harmony and the Fan Series collector models like these , all have a much more serious overtone to them than your average Gen. 4 pony toy . The box art straight away warns you , its not all Rainbow and sunshine , with an intense Discord on the front and a scowling one on the side . Inside however , the model is just the opposite . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know and love . Eyes closed , ready to sip from his glass some delicious chocolate milk . <p> For collectors , the box has a big window on the front and slice on the side . There 's another special collectors feature I 'll get to in a minute . <p> The many faces of chaos <p> The sides and back have your expected translations of " Friendship is Magic " and " Fan Series . " The side also mentions season 2 , episode 2- the episode that inspired this model . In addition , the back has an inscription- " His Meddling ways often lead to trouble . This draconequus is part dragon , part pony , and all chaos ! " . The back and side feature pictures of the model itself . I use the term ' model ' because " Fan Series " is codename for adults and collectors . And only the best features for collectors ... <p> Is he eyeballing somepony ? Is it Bigmac ? <p> So up top is a clear slot which I thought was stylistically an odd choice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , until it hit me . This was to let in light , and not just your run-of-the-mill Celestias sun filtering in through your dirty blinds . It was for display lighting . Let 's see how it works ... <p> Put the light on a rapid timer to simulate his taste in sporadic cosmic illumination . <p> The left side is if it were sitting on a shelf or in other shade with no incoming light through the top . The right shows what a few watts and a fluorescent tube older than most of our readers can do . I felt this was the perfect amount of lighting to show off the figure no matter where I put him . I 'm looking forward to seeing the SDCC exclusive that 's in the mail with its light-up base to see if bottom side illumination can match how well this works . Now , a good collector keeps the figure in the box . A dedicated collector bought two : one to shove Christmas lights on top of and one to open . Let 's try it out ... <p> Its like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has a hole in his rear . <p> So with about 5 10 15 mins of patience you can actually open up this thing without damaging the packaging or cutting the straps . So the first surprise is that he s not actually attached to his chair . He s just sitting on it ... or rather he s sitting on it with a tab up his bum to stabilize him . Its a fit as snug as that 18th glass that Dashie downs during cider season so it sites its job . The quality was obvious right out of the box . Let 's see how it worked out ... <p> Behold ! The Lord of Swag . <p> Just as pictured on the box without the dramatic shadow lighting . A figure we have been waiting years for . I can almost imagine John de Lancies voice coming from it telling you how much its about to ruin your day . I really feel that they captured the show accuracy of Discord very well . Weve seen previews of the rest of the GoH toy line and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy , and the Fan Series Discord is the pinnacle . I could immediately tell I would be rotating out my Funko Discord as one of my centerpieces with this . Let 's take a look at his size <p> More fun than a barrel of Rainbow Dashes <p> Scale wise , he s just about in line with the brushable ponies . This is great , because the large size allows this collectors piece to stand out . For only about $30 , its also one of the best buys Ive seen . It truly commands its space . The details really stand out , especially on his smug mug . Let 's take a closer look ... <p> Such nostril detail . <p> Zoomed in , you can see the probably unavoidable seem through the face . But it 's handled well and that is important . I 'd agree with Discord that there is n't much that can rival his face for sheer beauty . I might have tried to get a clear plastic for the glass rim , but now that I think about it , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his molding turned out <p> Is the paint perfect if its imperfect on a being of chaos ? <p> Ouch ! It 's not too bad , but not ideal . A hazard of molded plastic manufacturing . Still the king of chaos though . The wife agrees this is one of the best pieces of my massive collection . I was wondering if really it was the throne that makes it . Those accessories can do wonders . Let 's test that <p> Arguably more chaotic to the fandom <p> Yeah , it 's totally the throne . All my figures need one . Twilight Sparkle needs to be the Queen of Chaos . I think if Hasbro made the throne chairs from her castle for mane6 figures to sit in , that would be the coolest thing . Still , maybe Ill leave purplesmart here and let Discord sit on a watermelon , or Spike , or something . I wonder what Discord thinks of that <p> I 'd like a cup of Twilight please . <p> Yeah , he 'll have none of that . Actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her skirt which the cat then stole . That would be a great episode though . If Discord had the ability to remove wings and horns maybe he could turn them into Equestria Girls just to screw with them . But not the powered up versions with light and special effects . The dirty mud human versions with no magic or wings . Speaking of wings <p> For simulated flap-flap action . <p> So chair to butt syncing action is n't the only thing the figure can do . Discords wings are on ball joints allowing you to pose them with a great degree of motion . You can even continue to twist them past what I 'm showing here until they are upside down . Does this make Discord an action figure ? Maybe ? I 'd hope for some more bionic chopping action with a title like that . In addition to the rotating wings , his effective umbrella also rotates in his hand . Its the type of odd detail that this odd character really needs in his toy . Let 's try it out ... <p> Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exactly what you think it is . Yes , I drank it and yes , it was delicious . How meta is it for me to be holding a cup of chocolate milk while discord holds a cup of chocolate milk ? Hopefully , we wont pull an Inception and go deeper than that . Now maybe the milk expired the day before and the chocolate powder the year before but food safety has never stopped your local Panda Express and certainly not me . Besides I had a taste tester ... <p> Betcha did n't  see that coming . <p> She approached it while I was attempting to operate a camera with one hand . I would have used a tripod but it gave me flashbacks from recording cons for Ponyville Live . Immediately , my wife slapped me in the back of the head for something about cats not supposed to have chocolate or something and I ended up drenching the cat in the stuff . I also may have fell out of my chair trying to rescue my camera . Point is , maybe cats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaotic camera angles . <p> Final verdict : I bought some weird MLP junk from cake toppers to robotic blinking Twilight . Trust me when I say if you have $30 to spend on MLP merch this needs to be in your top 5 considerations . I am super excited to have this in my collection as well and look forward to seeing more of the Guardians of Harmony Fan Series . <p> Guardians of Harmony Fan Series <p> Princess Celestia <p> That 's one peeved mare <p> Woah ! She is about to rip someone a new one . Those pinned back ears , that frown , those flared wings . I have n't seen a mare that ready to fight since Derpy in Kanashiipandas Guardian . Guardian ... see what I did there ? Anyway , right out the box , rather before she even gets out of the box , the light , radiant Celestia sticks out of the packaging ; the cardboard just fades right into the background . The bright shiny armor , the stance , and of course the gorgeous sweeping mane and tail that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check out the box ... <p> Luna told her sister what you dream about . <p> Very similar to the Discord packaging with show vectors on the front and side and pictures of the figure itself on the back and other side . Again , various translations adorn the packaging but the one that really sticks out to me is " She protects Equestria from darkness . " That 's even more interesting if you consider the episode that inspired the model printed on the side of the box is n't Season 2 , Episode 1 ; where shed be posed against Discord . It actually says Season 1 , Episode 2 , where behind the scenes she must have promptly battled Nightmare Moon and lost even faster . That is some deep heartfelt hatred for the thing that has consumed her sister right there ! Well get back to that but first some display features . <p> Insert sunshine here <p> Also like the Discord model , we have the top light window . For letting in more ambient light . As I mentioned before though , if you plan on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even if you rock the lights off in your bedroom you should put a small light bar on top of it for some helpful illumination . But once you see what it does with lightning , you 're gon na need it ... <p> Miniature sun not include . <p> Bam ! Lit up like the Sun , pun intended . Her wings are in focus , the heavy shadows lifted and her mane just explodes with is transparency . Beautiful and terrible as the dawn , to steal a reference . Her mane really benefits the most from the direct lighting but there is something a bit odd about it . Let 's open her up ... <p> The toothpaste is a lie . <p> Yeah , see it now ? The packaging features pictures of the prototype figure with pink translucent mane with a blue stripe . This was the same version we saw on the first GoH announcements back in February . I 'm curious to see in the comments which version you like better . Celestia the pink maned filly has always stuck with me so I 'm leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redo the photo for the packaging . Whos a silly pony ? Hasbro . Now if you noticed that the wings look different , I can explain that ... <p> Karate-chop action ! <p> Its because they are on swivel joints . They do n't  offer the same degrees of motion that Discords wings do but they do let you pose her in the most menacing way possible . With the wings out like that and the idea of her standing on her own mane being ridiculous , its most likely that the designers posed her as flying , ready to bank sharp and chunk a laser blast of magic to beat the everliving darkness out of her sister . Too bad she lost that fight we never saw ; or ran away . What ever headcanon helps you sleep at night . With the box out of the way , let 's get a good look ... <p> Peaches ! I 'll tell you lifes just peachy with peaches ! I think theyd cheer her up . A delicious fruit grown by her awesome sun ? Let 's try it out ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me another " what are you doing with your life " look from my wife . That was until I started shoving the kabobed pieces into her mouth . I had some too . We totally Lady-and-Tramped Celestia . Peaches make everything better . Let 's see how Celestia enjoys it ... <p> " Youre bad and you should feel bad " <p> Yikes ! The quality and detail of her face is amazing at conveying that emotion . Its quite perfect . I will say one of the small things I think this model could improve upon is her cutie mark being obstructed by her wings in every position . Its a well sculpted flank , literally , and she needs to show it off . I swear my wife just hit me again . Anyway , if were still not quite sure why she 's angry ; if the sisterly love is n't to blame , then I think I 'll have to give her a reason for her to be mad ... <p> That 's not mine . <p> There we go . Toothpaste face here has every right to hate my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twilight is like the daughter Celestia never had . Ca n't blame her for not liking the fic . Its all perfectly understandable now . Enough silly , check out the rotation for all her godlike curves ... <p> Its not a real MLP toy unless the Cutie Mark is only on one side . <p> Final verdict : For $20-$25 , Princess Celestia in the Guardians of Harmony is a steal . Hasbro has come a long way from its pink Celestia days and while a toy like this is long overdue , it 's greatly welcome nonetheless . I admit I was a little disappointed in the mane/tail color change from the prototype , but Celestia has really grown on me . I set her in a window and the dawn light hit her and whole mane and tail lit up . I muttered " Beautiful " and my wife sleepily said " Thank you . " The whole toy line embraces these epic appearances and the Fan Series even more so . I ca n't wait to get my Nightmare Moon tomorrow and hopefully the mane6 before next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no reports of GoH Fan Series hitting shelves in the U.S. However , we have see some in stores in a few Asian countries .

@@77556041 @6256041/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> The ratings have arrived for Gauntlet of Fire , and they are lower than expected at 196k viewers . Last season whenever this happened , there was a swarm of gloom and doom followed by the next week blowing them out of the water . Like most things analyzed on the internet , numbers can and do fluctuate wildly based on the smallest little thing . Let 's dive in on why this might have happened to Gauntlet of Fire below ! <p> I think most of us can agree that the last episode was actually really awesome , but the first point I 'm going to make is that this probably was n't the expectation going in for a lot of people . Last time , we had " Princess Spike " pulling some of the lowest ratings of season 5 at a meager 260,000 viewers right after Slice of Life almost hit half a million . He 's a great supporting character , but until Gauntlet of Fire , his solo excursions into episodes were n't always the most well loved . We 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a role in ratings a few times now . There just was n't a lot of excitement to get up early and watch an episode about a character that has tried several times and really not succeeded , at least among the fandom . <p> This is something tempering pony , and a lot of shows in general though . In an increasingly internet-based world , where these things tend to be available online , commercial free , any time , right after officially airing , there is much incentive to pick up a cable package and wake up for something you can just watch freely later . It 's a culture shift we have seen dominate over the past five years . <p> That 's another point though . Pony has two major demographics ; the kids who typically do n't have control over their family 's cable plan , and the adult millennial fanbase that is rapidly switching to a less cable-tied world . It 's expensive , inconvenient , and slowly becoming an obsolete concept when you can binge watch an entire season of something on Netflix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't dumb . They are already showing preparation for this move via the fourth Equestria Girls movie . If you missed the news a few months ago , Netflix will be airing it before Discovery Family . It 's skipping the cable TV premiere circuit and going straight to a place they know will watch the hell out of it . <p> Right now Friendship is Magic is one of , if not the most successful shows on the channel . If there is anything at all dragging down it 's ratings , it 's the fact that it does n't have nearly the reach it could in its target demographics . <p> So what does that mean for the future of pony ? Not much for now . If Discovery Family itself is n't shut down , I ca n't see them ever wanting to drop their highest rated show . If they do close , Hasbro most likely would n't ditch their biggest girls IP . While things may be dying off on the Cable TV front , on the cartoon and entertainment side , the world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it could also follow Transformers over to Cartoon Network . <p> We have a movie coming in 2017 . It would honestly be surprising if they cancelled series MLP with as much hype as that will drag in . Hasbro 's Equestria Girls move shows an eagerness to shift to the internet age , and with Guardians of Equestria possibly being a series of it 's own , they definitely have future plans for the brand .

Also note Rarity still rocking those craft skills . <p> Another amazing scenery shot , the idea of this island being warrened with tunnels and lava flows just fascinates me . <p> That path is channeling Nathan Drake/Indiana Jones so hard , and I love it . <p> The sudden and shocking reveal ! <p> I adore this entire fight scene , everything from the music to the action scenes helps show the intensity of it . <p> Just another amazing little clip that might 've been overlooked . <p> Spike has learned the true feeling of power , look at those pupils . He knows that the spice must flow . <p> Awkward hugging , go ! <p> Oooh , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I do find it slightly confusing that the dragons just accept whoever gets the scepter first , even though it 's whoever brings it back to the dragon lord . I would 've expected more fighting . <p> There 's got ta be a few dads watching this scene and tearing up at the idea of their little girls growing up . <p> The ponies will be safe .... because having four alicorns who control the heavens was n't enough . <p> I really wanted a good closeup shot of Twilight 's dragon notebook , because I love the picture on it . <p> And off into the sunset . <p> Overall I 'm really enjoying Joanna Lewis and Kristine Songco episodes . The writers in general are really learning how to handle Spike and what to do with him too , which is really important . I think Spike ca n't handle an episode all on his own , but if you pair him with someone he can really shine . I 'm looking forward to more Spike episodes . He 's really become a great character .

Welcome to Part 2 of our discussion of The Goddesses of Equestria and that explores if the alicorns of the Sun , Moon , Love , and Friendship are indeed goddesses among mortals or just supremely gifted . Part 1 of this series discussed the power , abilities , and definition of a god . I encourage you to read that first before part 2 . <p> So join me , We Are Borg , after the break for a further look into the theology of a polytheistic Equestria or the apotheosis of head canon . <p> So in Part 1 we went over the definition of a god that one might find in a dictionary . Starting us off this time I 'd like to mention a few traits that are normally attributed to gods . One of the most common is immortality , which I mentioned in Part 1 , and all of you discussed the difference between being unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power over life itself . Life , death , creation : powers reserved for the most feared of deities . <p> In most monotheistic religions , where a sole being carries the title of god , or even the name God , the one god carries the ultimate of powers . As well , there are gods in polytheistic cultures that also wield these traits : Omnipotence , Omniscience , and Omnipresence . These being , all-powerful , all-knowing , and everywhere at once respectively . Some of these cause huge debate and are logically full of paradoxes but that 's okay because none of our alicorns display these powers , but they kind of do ... <p> Celestia is Omnipresent ... kinda <p> Now all of us were caught up in the moment . We knew when Twilight was blown into the ether and Celestia started singing , we knew this was the moment Larson was about to strap on the wings . We were slightly terrified , and a bit excited . But we glossed over just what Celestia was doing during her singing . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition in a scene with more screens than a Targets electronics section . Celestia did n't  just stick her faithful student on the path to join her as a peer of untold power , she played Twilight like a fiddle since before she ever met her . Its not like they pass out dragon eggs to every candidate of Celestias School for Gifted Unicorns . With the Magical Mystery Cure episode we are shown the true power of Celestia in that she probably look anywhere unto any moment . While not true omnipresent in that the definition for it allows no choice in the presence of the being , Celestia can no doubt put on some pony life Netflix whenever she desires . While it was not Fausts intention for this alicorn sister to know everything , she also never intended for Twilight to be an alicorn . Speaking of sisters ... <p> She is straight up in your head via your dreams . She knows your deepest desires , fears , and your twisted fantasies involving her and four socks . There is no distance she ca n't cover to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing anything about anypony . While protecting her subjects from nightmares has been stated as her duty , its probably just a minor note of her power over the dream space . Let 's try and fathom the knowledge you can learn from someone when you 're the one who is lucid and they are n't , unless you tell them . And maybe the biggest revelation to this dream world of the Night Princesss is that it may work outside time itself . Picking random ponies to check on for nightmares does n't  sound very effective , so she is either going full Santa Claus and checking in on each pony of Equestria or just knows where find the nightmares . What if she is drawn to nightmares because maybe she can choose to be drawn to criminals ? With this kind of power what cant Luna know ? And nothing says she only has to end the nightmares . She could be quite good at creating your greatest fear . Shes certainly good at creating her own <p> The definition of life can be as complex as anyone would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutes life but let 's start simple and say thinking , sentient creatures are alive but so are plants , animals the myriad of other simplier organisms in this world . So what did Luna create in her nightmares ? The Tantabus , a manifestation of fear , pain and darkness created by the Princess of the Night to punish herself . While at first appearance it looked as the mindless mind creation was just that , a creation of the mind locked in the mind , it decided it needed to break free . Self-aware much ? The Tantabus clearly fed off Lunas guilt , grew in strength , and reacted to environmental stimuli . All part of the definition of life with the only qualification we did n't  see complete being reproduction . <p> And Lunas not the only one . As we discussed Twilight was reincarnated , brought back to life in the form of an alicorn by Celestia . Set her on a path , controlled almost every facet of her life , killed her and brought her back to life as if she were playing god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to our definition of a god ; <p> " a supernatural being , who is worshipped as the controller of some part of the universe or some aspect of life in the world or is the personification of some force " <p> A supernatural being with extreme abilities in controlling critical parts of the world is only half of it . For any of the discussed alicorns to be a god they must be worshiped . While such logic appears circular , it is the key element that separates a supernatural , otherworldly powerful creature who could be anywhere and know everything and grant life , from a god . They must be revered for that which they are.Well , at least one form of , often synonymous with worship , is celebration . A celebration of a god is indeed recognizing one as such . One such example is Nightmare Night : A celebration of Nightmare Moon and offering of candy to appease her . While it looks more festive than religious , the origin of many festivals was religious . An ancient looking stone effigy of Nightmare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we celebrate our modern commercialized Halloween . There may indeed have been an older time when something more than candy was sacrificed at her feet to keep her locked away in the moon , or perhaps in prayer to release her . Either way , when Luna returned the one Nightmare Night , the ponies did n't  bow to a Princesses as much as they kissed the dirt and were fearful in front of the 1,000 year legend . <p> Nightmare Night is n't the only celebration of an alicorn we 've seen . In ancient Egypt the Pharaohs were considered gods on Earth , a living connection to everything of a higher power and as such led religious ceremonies . Celestia and Luna are perhaps then , like Equestrias Pharaohs , providing over ceremonies like the Summer Sun Celebration , another 1000 year old tradition that celebrates Princess Celestia and her Sun . In the second half of " Princess Twilight Sparkle " the Royal Sisters engage in the ritualistic lowering of the Moon and raising of the Sun ; an event that literally happens daily captivates all those attending into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Celestia and later , Luna and Twilight , in front of huge idols of the heavenly bodies . Its a ceremony without equal in Equestria that we know of . Does this mark it as Equestrias most important religious holiday ? <p> So those are my observations and evidence of the Goddesses of Equestria . While Cadance and Twilight Sparkle are indeed powerful alicorns , perhaps the status of deity can only be applied to Celestia and Luna , the immortal avatars of the Sun and Moon ; living gods shaping the world and the destinies and lives of ponies everywhere .

Both the fandom and staff have waxed poetic for years about Princess Lunas downfall and Celestias guilt for not being able to prevent it . But how does Lullaby for a Princess differentiate itself from a story that 's essentially over and done with ? Let 's talk about Lullaby for a Princess and what makes it one of the best animations of 2015 after the break . Lunas story is engaging and tantalizing considering how much is left unanswered . From fanfiction to songs to an animation such as Children of the Night , Lunas depression and downfall have been catalogued since the end of the pilot . Our questions over Lunas integration into the society as well as what happened all those years ago remained fresh in the background while Twilight learned about friendship . Even I was a victim of the headcanon brigade . <p> Everyone knows the anger and loneliness that Luna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what about Celestias side of the story ? Was Luna mistaken as to Celestias intentions ? Could Celestia have prevented the Nightmare or her sisters banishment ? Did she raise the moon every night with the same elegance and care as her sister ? Was Celestia emotionally unaffected ? With all of these questions lurking in the background , a new animation aimed to answer them . <p> In a way , Lullaby for a Princess is a response to Children of the Night . Both animations focus on the single perspective of their Princess , both are presented in a musical animation , and one seems like it could take place before the other . Of course these animations were their own separate entities , but this feeling of continuity is indicative of a project and " fanon " that is so ironclad , it could compete with our current canon . While Children of the Night points towards a different universe ( and possible sequel ) where Luna established an empire with her followers , Lullaby for a Princess could easily be the sequel after Celestias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at panels and interviews why they think of certain ideas for episodes or jokes . The simple answer is that an encyclopedic knowledge of the characters spawn these reactions or narratives . Celestias perspective in Lullaby for a Princess is dense because it is clouded with guilt , anguish , and the unreliability of a first- ( pony ? ) person narrator . As I said in my editorial on depression in Season 5 , Celestias unreliable ( or perhaps reliable ) telling of Nightmare Moons inception is riding a fine line between being overblown or relatable . I believe they succeeded in being the latter . <p> While it is true that Season 4 has provided us with the canon flashback of Nightmare Moons creation as well as the ( very similar ) fight scene that ended with her banishment , what happened beforehand is shrouded within a legend . Some say that history is written by the victors , but after Celestias story in Lullaby , did she truly win ? Celestia does n't  seem to give herself much credit and only wants to dig a deeper hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chorus : <p> Lullay moon princess , goodnight sister mine <p> And rest now in moonlight 's embrace <p> Bear up my lullaby , winds of the earth <p> Through cloud , and through sky , and through space <p> Carry the peace and the coolness of night <p> And carry my sorrow in kind <p> Luna , you 're loved so much more than you know <p> May troubles be far from your mind <p> And forgive me for being so blind <p> The songs structure is simple , yet effective in showing Celestias struggle . The chorus sounds like something she would mutter before crying herself to sleep , night after night . The rest of the song portrays the story in hindsight , from beginning to end while Celestia degrades her judgment with each passing chorus . Her emotions paint the song as one she would never sing to her guards or those around her , which the animation conveys by having her sing to the moon ( Luna ) or herself . Its these types of structural choices that separate a good project from an excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all feel like the mournful and guilty Celestia that Lullaby wants , than nothing on the inside ( structure , themes ) or outside ( tone , song pitch , animation scenes ) seem jarring or out of place . <p> Keeping this continuity in the animation is just as vital . Sometimes , its hard for a reviewer to separate improvisation from intent . A good example of this would be the saturation of color , which permeates through the entire project . Is it an example of an intentional split between the present day ( which lacks as much saturation ) and the past to show Celestias hindsight or possibly altered memories ? Or is this saturation a way to bring life to parts of a scene that otherwise would n't be there ? It is not my place to say what is the case ( since I do n't know WarpOut ) , but it could be either or even both . <p> With a framework as excellent as the song , it makes the animation easier to stand out and not drift off-course . With each changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind " , we only need to see the few scenes which drive the important points home . Luna yelling at Celestia , their magical fight , and finally Celestia crying after Lunas defeat . These events stab the dagger deeper into our hearts , while the fallout from the tragic events helps give the audience time to calm down while still dreading the consequences . Were now on the level of a demigod , because we can empathize with these type of losses . These narrative choices are part of what makes Friendship is Magic so timeless and relatable . The dramatic scenes could have been the entire animation and it would have still been raved as one of the best of 2015 , but this project had more effort put into it to stand out . <p> Snowdrops cutie mark hides on one of the wall scrolls ( references ) . Celestia raises the moon in the beginning and lowers it in the end ( timeline ) . Celestia visits the same realm that Twilight did in Magical Mystery Cure ( more continuity ) . These choices bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem believable while " in the moment " , but show the projects research on the fandom . It is possible that Snowdrops story takes place before Lullaby for a Princess . But like with all fanon , its up for the fans to decide . <p> What do you guys think ? Is Lullaby for a Princess story the unreliable telling of a sister who bears more guilt than she should ? Is it " the other story " to Children of the Night ? Let me know in the comments . Thank you very much for reading , and I 'll see you guys soon . 
@@77556059 @6256059/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> One of the amazing things that quickly became apparent to the fandom during the early days was the openness of the staff itself , particularly creator Lauren Faust . Quite frequently she answered a number of questions about Equestria , her work , her interests , behind the scenes process of making the show and much more either on her deviantArt page , Twitter or interviews she once did with EqD , 4chan , Ponychan and others years ago.In her answers she revealed a lot of what she thought of certain events in the show , things that had been cut or changed , and giving detailed background on a number of subjects , clarifying some of the fandom 's earliest questions mostly back between 2011-2013 . Going through the archives of Equestria Daily the best I can , I have compiled a large list of answers Lauren has given over the years but if you know of some I have missed , please feel free to add them in the comments ! These span several years and it 's quite possible I missed some.This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pictures and more from various articles on EqD over the years so be prepared for a wild ride ! Lastly , a big thanks to the Ponycon crowd at our EqD panel for helping us come up with this idea to spotlight Lauren 's old answers . <p> Wildife Learning Center Charity Questions and AnswersFor those that are confused , over the last few days , she has run a few 30 minute long events dedicated to answering questions for the Wildlife Learning Center Indiegogo . People could donate 25 bucks for a season 1 or general production question to be answered.Q : Who came up with Big Macs Eyup and what are you most proud of from your contribution to MLP ? A : I did . Proving a " girl show " could be enjoyed outside it 's core audience.Q : Where did the concept of parasprites , and Pinkies music to lead them away , come from ? A : It was inspired by The Pied Piper and Trouble with Tribbles.Q : I 've heard rumors that Trixie was initially a male character in planning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A : Yes , Trixie was written as male in the premise . Hasbro requested a female character . Story was not changed at all.Q : What is a plot that never made it into production ? ( My name is on the contributor page . ) A : The ponies meet a pony who was raised by deer and thinks he 's a deer . AJ and RD argue over whether to tell him the truth ! He found out on his own , and decided to stay with the deer who raised him.Q : more conceptual question , where do all the rainbow 's go that leak from RD 's house ? Should she call a pegasus plumber ? A : They dissipate into the atmosphere . Her house was designed before we conceived how rainbows are made . Would have done it different.Q : Does Luna still have Nightmare Moon in her ? because when she transforms into Luna , the color of her coat and cutie mark switchA : NMM is the jealousy residing inside her that came forth . Perhaps it could be sparked again-- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why did AJ leave her family behind for Manehattan ? She must have broken their heartsA : It was just wanderlust . She wanted to see the world beyond the farm.Q : Why did Pinkie Pie come to Ponyville ? Do her parents know ? A : I 'm afraid I do n't have a ready answer for that ! But , if it were up to me , I 'd say that though she loved her family , she was simply bored and wanted to go someplace where she could meet more people and have more fun . She did n't belong on a rock farm.Q : Any more backstory to AJ 's parents ? They are n't ever really mentioned as an entire part of her backstory.A : Do n't know what the final canon will be , but they had passed away in my book . Never thought of how , though .... Q : So , I heard Princess Cadence was on the drawing board during S1 . What was your original plan with her ? A : She was not thought up until Season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that episode . Want to ask a different question ? Q : How much input did you have on the visual design of the show ? A : A lot . I designed the main &amp; major supporting cast . I hand picked the artists who designed the background style . and I reviewed and approved all artwork for season 1 . I designed a lot of animals in S1 as well.Q : What would have happened if Princess Celestia never sent NMM in the moon ? Would NMM have won ? A : Yes . Celestia had no choice but to banish her sister or night would last forever . She did so with a heavy heart.Q : I asked earlier if Cheerilee was in the original plan for the showA : Not in the very first inception , but she was in the bible . Hasbro requested she be included , so I decided to make her the teacher of the Cutie Mark Crusaders.Q : In ep1 , the NMM legend says ' the stars will aid in her escape ' and we see 4 stars ' freeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A : It was meant to sound like lore , but specifics were never figured out . It would be something fun to figure out . Are they other creatures that were banished ? What did they do ? Who banished them ? Q : Not a specific question , but can you tell me something fun about Trixie that is n't known ? Thanks ! A : She also went to Celestia 's School for Gifted UnicornsQ : What was the thinking behind giving Spike a crush on Rarity ? A : When I was writing the scene in the pilot where Twilight met Rarity for the first time , I needed to get across the idea that Rarity was exceptionally beautiful . I came up with the crush at that point , and it stuck ! Q : There 's a rumor that u had some male character part of the mane6 . Is this true and who would they be ? A : That is not true . The Mane 6 were always female.Q : My question is , when developing Manehatten , would the other boroughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A : We did n't develop the city that far . If a story were to take place there and called for boroughs , we would have figured it out at that time . It seems like a good idea.Q : How does it feel to have the power to inspire others to make the world a better place ? A : Pretty amazing and unbelievable.Q : You told me you had a name for Berry Punch when we talked @BronyCon . Care to share that name on record ? =D A : I called her Pinot Noir ! My drink of choice while working on MLP . Got me through a lot of late nights.Q : " A Bird in the Hoof " Why did Fluttershy have Twilight 's and Pinkie Pie 's gala dress ? A : Oooooh ! Ok . I 'm afraid the answer is boring . It saved the artists time to put pre-designed clothes in the closet . It was for practical , cost-saving purposes , not creative.Q : Where was Celestia when NMM appeared ? Do n't answer if you never thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories.A : In my mind , they were still young and still lived in the same castle together--- perhaps with their parents . It was the ruined castle in the Everfree Forest that was featured in the premiere episode . Before she appeared in Ponyvile , NMM went to Canterlot to find Celestia and use magic to banish Celestia in the Sun . REVENGE ! I imagined them with parents , yes . I wish I could 've made a series just about Celestia and Luna 's youth . Sigh ... Q : Were Celestia and Luna the only wielders of the Elements of Harmony ? or did they have 4 others ? What Elements did they represent ? A : Yes . They discovered them . They each had 3 , but I never thought about who got what . Once Celestia used them on her sister , she could not wield them anymore . She had to wait for Twi and friends to reignite them.Q : I heard but saw no proof that Ditzy Doo was actually a different pony then our Derpy . Is this true ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wrap Up before the Derpy phenomenon started . I kept the name in my back pocket in case we ever needed a ditzy character again . When the fans started becoming obsessed with a certain cross-eyed background pony , I thought she could be Ditzy , but then you all named her and I did n't want to step on that . There was just a name , but no design for Ditzy Doo.Q : Thanks for doing this ! What was going on when Twilight was hatching Spike 's egg and her magic went crazy ? A : Whoah ! I did n't think anyone would ask ! And just under the wire too ! She had a power surge-- her first . She could n't control it . Celestia sensed this HUGE magical ability , rushed over , and put a magical " cork " in it . She then decided to train Twilight personally , hoping she would one day learn ( through friendship ) how to control this magical power herself.Q2 : So Celestia had an ulterior motive ! A2 : She knew Twilight would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I planned that did n't come to be.Q : Why did Doctor Hooves have wings in episode 16 ? in season 1 ? A : Unless the directors had some plan I 'm not aware of , it was just easier to slap a pair of wings on an already-designed earth pony than to design and build a brand new character . It was just to save time and moneyQ : Spike 's age : teen , preteen , elementary age ? A : I think of him as about 8 in maturity.Q : Were Diamond Tiara &amp; Silver Spoon meant to be interchangeable bullies , or were they different ( leader/follower , or .. ? ) A : Meghan created those two , so she knows better . But I saw DT as the queen bee and SS as the follower . DT is slightly meaner and driven in my book . SS might have been nice if she made a different friend.Q : For an aspiring cartoonist like myself who 's stuck in the Navy for a short bitA : The best advice I can give is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside you that you have to get out before you 're any good . Do n't get discouraged , practice guarantees improvement . Keep learning . If you ca n't take classes , pick up art books or take online classes . <p> Lauren Faust 's Thoughts on Bat Ponies <p> Lauren on Luna 's New Look <p> Lauren on Celestia , Twilight , and Spike 's Relationship <p> Lauren Faust Ponychan Q&amp;A CompiledQ : I got ta ask , do you think you 'll ever get to chat without it turning into a Q&amp;A ? <p> A : I du n no . I guess we 'll see , right ? Q : So what 's up ? A : Not much . I worked late tonight . Glad to be home . What 's going on around here ? Q:You said you intended for Twilight to eventually replace Celestia . Does that mean you intended for Celestia to eventually die/be otherwise written off ? A : I think it 's best for me to keep what my plans were to myself . It would be unfair to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : what can we look forward to for your current and future projects ? Also , do you think you 'll be able to implement the plans you had for MLP into some other incarnation ? Thinly veiled suggestion , I know.A : I will be working on developing a few projects at once over the next several months . Nothing is concrete yet.And I 've thought about it.Q : Animated movies like Wall-E and Wreck-it Ralph have gained mainstream acceptance as something that can be enjoyed by anyone , not just children . When , if ever , do you think cartoons will reach the same status ? A : We have to wait until the folks with the money are willing to give something like that a try , and for audiences to be open to the idea . Over the years , Craig and I have met more and more parents who enjoy some of our shows with their kids . I think as the newer generations have kids , we may see it happen more . Hope so.Q : Lauren , I 've been dying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also is she really an orphan ? In case you did n't notice , she 's my favA : I ca n't say I ever Scootaloo as an orphan . However , I did not have specific plans for what her family deal was . If in the process of making the show it came to define , we would have done it then . Somethings you plan from the start , some things you come up with as you go.Q : Do you watch the shows you work on , or does being so involved in the whole development process kinda burn them out for you ? A : I do watch the episodes I worked on . However , having worked on them from the beginning definitely warps your ability to view them . I do n't think you ever see them the same way viewers do.Q : Did you have plans for the cmc 's eventual cutie marks , or was that open ended ? A : I had plans for Scoots and Belle , but I was still working out Apple Bloom's.Q : You 've mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never got to see through . Whatever those plans were , did you talk to Jayson or Meghan about what they were so that , if they chose , they could still use those plans ? For example , you mentioned in one interview that Zecora would 've been like a second mentor in Twilight , and she wound up playing that role in one of the recent episodes.A : I may have said a few things . I ca n't remember who I told what . Zecora as mentor was actually in the bible.Q : If a unicorn can become an alicorn , can a pegasus or earth pony become one too ? A : In my book , yes.Q : Actually , I 'm curious . Are you finding that producers and the like are getting more open to major/lead female characters in animated material given the success of MLP , Littlest Pet Shop , and Legend of Korra ? A : Absolutely not . Despite it 's popularity , MLP does n't get great ratings--- not compared to bigger networks , anyway.Q : Was Equestria Girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show ? A : Nope.Q : What does being a princess in Equestria actually mean ? A : For me it meant having certain responsibilities in terms of running the country--- just like it does in real life . Not sure what it means currently.Q : I 'm not a Pony Channer by habit , I 'm mainly here because I missed your visit to 4chan , that said It is nice to have the opportunity , on a thread on 4chan there is a debate on how much of the Royal Wedding was your work vs what was changed , if you have answered this many times before I apologise , I know that the third Alicorn was definitely not in the plan , but that 's about all I can see for sure given the overall strength of the episodeA : I ran the story room and broke the story with Rob and Meghan . I did n't see the final episode , so outside of the name and pony-type change for Cadence , I do n't know what was altered.Q : Anyways I just was curious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company did you like working for more ? Cartoon Network with the Power Puff Girls ? or The Hub with Ponies . Was there big differences between the two stations ? A : I must admit I enjoyed Cartoon Network more . They had more resources , a lot of experience behind them , and I was working at the studio directly with the crew , which was more fun than working remotely from my home office , which got lonely.Q : Lauren , In reference to all the controversial things that have happened ... could we have prevented this ? Do we as fans have some culpability in what has become of our beloved ponies ? A : I do n't think so.Q : Lauren , I loved the letters to Celestia , especially when they became a major plot point of the second season 's opening in restoring Twilight 's faith in her friends using her own words . Were you guys directed to include the letters by the network ? Why were they eventually phased out as season 2 went on ? A : When developing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defining " friendship device " in each show . Someone initially suggested some sort of " move , " which I thought was kind of terrible . One of the execs and I worked out the Mork and Mindy style letter at the end to define the friendship lesson . I think it worked out well . By Season 2 , the Hub said we did n't have to keep doing them , but I liked them and kept them up in Season 2 ( did they ever stop them ? ) They just became so definitive of the show to me , it felt weird to let them go . I think I would 've kept them going indefinitely.Q : Mrs. Faust , did you have any plans for more including creatures from different cultures of the world , were there and could there be more of them in the future , and could we possibly see more in the future ? Also did you come up with the idea of Tartarus existing in the Ponyverse ? A : Yes , I was planning/hoping for more creatures and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not entirely sure who came up with Tartarus in the story meeting room , but I do think it was me . Seems like my kind of gag.Q : Ok , I have a question for Faust on behalf of /mlp/Did you ever made any sketch or character concept of A.J , Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy 's parents , or they were just meant to stay offscreen ? We often ponder what could have been in contrast of what actually happened.A : I did want AJ 's parents to have passed away , but I never defined it ( when I was running it ) because I did n't think they would allow it . I was holding out to see if those restrictions would change . I had hoped to make RD 's mom G1 Firefly . I never did sketch any of the parents , and only had vague ideas of who they were or what they did . For details like that I would usually wait until a story warranted a definition , then define it according to the needs of the story . Rarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we needed then for the episode . Neither were Pinkie Pie'sQ : Did you have any characters you wanted to introduce and the voices behind them ala DeLancie and Discord ? Perhaps Starswirl the Bearded as another Star Trek alumni ? A : I never , ever , ever assume I can cast a celebrity . Many do n't want to slum in cartoons unless it 's for a place like Disney , and even then it can be a long shot . Getting John was a shocker to me.Q : Really ? Celebrities have a stigma against doing cartoon voice overs ? A : Yes ! We approached a few for SBFF and they all said no ! ! ! Q : Was it your idea to have Twilight 's mom me G1 Twilight ? Because that was amazing.A : Yes . Though I wish the colors were even more accurate . I felt to nerdy to call the note.Q : Ms. Faust , if I may , why is it that the pigs and goats seem to lack sentience ? Was this not your idea or just something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've made goats sentient , but not pigs . ( only ungulates and ruminants ) Q : I 've got a question concerning Luna/Nightmare Moon . In the show , we 're not told what ( if any ) evil force may have affected Luna to make her evil . I wanted to ask , was Luna 's turn to evil her own decision alone , or was it influenced by some evil force that has n't been ( and might never be ) revealed ? A : Aaaaah--- ca n't answer that . I 'd be giving away too much of what I had planned.Q : What was the hardest part about working on the show when you were working on it ? A : Schedule . It was horrendous.Q : Lauren , was it your idea to have the shot for shot remake of the Star Wars scene in the season 2 opener ? Because that may have been my favorite part.A : No . The directors and the story artist planned it . I died laughing when they showed it to me.Q : Do you feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , worse , or not changed ? A : I think toys are getting worse and worse . I 've seen some shows that at least seem to be trying . I do n't see a lot that I like , unfortunately.Q : Did you want to add any new pony type to the show ? A : I had an idea for seaponies . Was n't sure about it though.Q : Do you know what was Craig 's inspiration to create the PPG episode ' Meet the Beat Alls ' ? You know , the Beatles tribute episode.Why did he decide to create an episode dedicated to them ? Is he ( or you ) a fan of Beatles ? A : We are both HEE-YUGE Beatles fans.Q : Do you watch Doctor Who ? A : No . And I am ashamed . Where do I even start ? ! ? Q : Lauren , without getting into the details of your departure from the show , is there any possibility of reconciliation and your return to the creative team in some capacity if both parties could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everything behind you by now ? A : I have had a hard time of letting go of MLP , but I really think I have to move on . I hope some of the themes I wanted to explore can be brought into future projects . I think I can do more of what I 'd like to if I was n't restricted to such a very young audience . Making something for kids over 10 would be more satisfying.Q : So Lauren , why do n't you update your DA gallery ? Surely , you must have things worth sharing with the world.A : I never have time to draw ! ! ! It 's the great tragedy of my life ! And when I do , it 's for work and I 'm not allowed to share it ! Q : It would be nice if you could share your show bible and your original ideas with the people working on the comics.They 're not strictly canonical , but if I 'm entirely honest I 'm enjoying them way more than the show after you left.A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've ever done . I 'm insanely proud of it . I 'd love to share it , but it 's not mine to share . Maybe someday.Q : Lauren if you had the chance , would you build your own high fantasy television show with no pre-established brand placed on it ? You and the team did a great job with building a universe in FiM using greek and roman mythology but I wonder if you 'd be willing to do something like this without the small crutch of an already established ruleset.A : Believe it or not , restrictions like that are actually helpful . When you have a blank slate , and the possibilities are endless , you get overwhelmed quick and it hard to creatively commit to ideas . If you have source material , it 's more about finding connections and filling in blanks . I actually enjoy it . Not that I would n't do something original . The challenge could be fun if I had the right supportQ : Did you have any help creating the bible , or was it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative designers with their own settings ? A : I had help from Paul Rudish ( wait until you see his Mickey Mouse shorts- OH . EM . JEE . ) And bg designer Dave Dunnett and colorist Martin Ansolobehere.Q : did he work on that old style short that is coming out " get on your horse " i think it is called ? the one using old Walt Disney recordings.A : WATCH IT NOW ! ! ! ! ! LONG ... Hey Faust , as an animation fan from /co/ I love how MLP revealed the double standard regarding girl and boy shows to ( some ) of the world.Do you have any idea how to repeat that ? What would be for you the perfect " girl " show that 'd attract everyone ? A : I think it 's just about writing great stories and avoiding the restrictions of normal girl fare---- stuff for girls is either dumbed-down , goody-two-shoes-y and terribly art directed . There is a way to portray girls and their interests in a truly entertaining way , and as long as people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone ca n't enjoy great stories , no matter what the themes . <p> Lauren Faust Visits 4chan to Answer QuestionsQ : How have the characters deviated from your original vision ? More specifically , since you left ? A : The characters evolved a bit from the original bible descriptions--- but that happens on all shows . Writers , board artist , voice actors help define the characters further and you go with the flow . Some personalities might have been a bit more exaggeratted--- I wanted RD to have an irresponsible streak , and I wanted Rarity to have a more " do n't touch my stuff " relationship with Sweetie Belle . More so than is in there , but I was not unhappy with where they ended up . I have n't seen the recent episodes , so I ca n't judge any changes madeQ : Hows Craig been doinA : Great ! Having fun on the new show.Q : How would you have ended S3 ? A : I would have used it to lay groundwork for my plans for the characters ' ultimate destinies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mane6 ? A : Good , but slow ( because of me and stupid schedule . ) Hopefully , we should have some stuff to share in a few weeks.Q : Can you explain how Galaxy Girls would have worked ? Because that cast looked way too big to really work well for television.A : Galaxy Girls was designed to be a doll line . I actually never wanted it to be a show , but the folks who make toys want shows before the invest . Despite the surprising success of MLP , most companies still want the same old garbage for girls because that 's what they think make money ( and they do n't want to spend much to make it ) . If I have to make it a show , I 'm not going to make it until I can make it good--- so it may not get made.Additional question to above : Q : What would the show ( Galaxy Girls ) be like , if it ever gets made ? Epic adventures in space , or slice of life comedy , or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it a lot like MLP--- slice of life + fun adventure--- just in a fantasy , story-book version of space . But I put a lot of those ideas and themes and characterizations in MLP . If I move forward with it at this point , I would like to completely redesign the characters . I kind of hate the way they look right now . I drew that stuff almost 10 years ago.Q : I too , wish to know what Lauren Faust thinks of the comicsA : I have n't read them , but from what I gather , they are exploring some interesting themes.Q : Why did n't Hasbro just request a Galaxy Girls show to sell something to compete with Monster High ? Were they high or something ? A : No large company wants something they ca n't own and control completely.Q : I think we all need to know . Who is best pony ? A : You are going to hate this answer , but I ca n't pick . It 's like asking a Mom to pick her favorite child.Q : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Wonder Girl ? A : I enjoy writing Supergirl the best . I love getting the chance to write hot headed characters.Q : Faust , is there anything you would recommend to someone who is about to do their first big animation project ? My capstone for college has to have 8 animators and a minimum 16 crew total , and I 'm kinda running short on what and where exactly I should be looking for everything . Like , is there anything specific I should look for in an animator 's reel , aside from just strong and fluid work ? I 'm the school 's " test student " to see if they 'll start doing an animation program , and a lot rides on whether or not I succeed , and any advice you might have would be more than valuable.A : Strong and fluid work--- but also you need to gauge whether they are a good creative fit for your project . Someone can be amazing , but a bad fit . Unless they 're very versatile--- those artists are gems ! ! ! Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take the lead when you have too much on your plate.Q : What 's your favorite episode of PPG ? I 've always wanted to knowA : Rowdy Ruff Boys ! ! Q : Lauren , since you gave some life advice to someone else - I 've been wanting to break into the animation or art-for-television type of field , but my background is in graphic design . I live in the Midwest and I 'm in my mid-twenties and I feel like I 'm in a rut - not qualified with nothing nearby to push me where I want to go . What should I do ? Do I need to move ? Take classes ? How do you do it ? A : Being in the right place makes a big difference , if you can afford the move . Otherwise , classes , and try to get animation work online , where your location does n't matter . Once you develop good relationships , you 'll get more work and it will be easier to move to where you can get even more workQ : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That would be really neat to seeA : I have some sketches I did several months ago I 've been thinking of posting on DA . I 'll do it next week when I get home ( I 'm traveling ) Q : I think I remember you telling someone on DA that you originally planned to have the main six have different body types/styles but were either short on time or money . If you had any specific ones already in mind could you describe what each pony would have looked like had been able to spend more time designing them ? Also , great to see you here again ! A : It 's not that we were short on time and money , it 's that I anticipated it would be a production nightmare to make them all different . I tried to get as much of their individuality into their hair and eye shape as I could.Q : So what 's the deal with the Princesses ? Did you ever plan on going in to more detail with their history ? A : I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couldQ : Lauren , Seriously , I love you . Stay safe in here , it can get freaky at times , but we all mean well in the end.A : I know . : ) Q : Why did you choose to come here ( 4chan ) ? It 's not like we have the best " fame " in the fandom . I 'm just curious ... A : I 've said it before , but I 've seen some of the most thoughtful critiques here . I need to dig through some awful stuff to find it , but people are smart here sometimes . ( Daww , you guys are loved . ) Q : Lauren are you going to any conventions this year ? A : I think I 'll be at Comic Con--- not sure yetQ : Lauren , what was your biggest influence on Rarity ? A : Audrey HepburnQ : Yo Lauren Faust , " Luna Eclipsed " and the midsection of " Hearth 's Warming Eve " in Season 2 really feel like your work ( and more like Season 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I right ? Also , which episodes of Season 2 did you work on the most ( stories , mostly ) ? A : Wow . I ca n't believe you noticed . I worked on all the stories , structurally , and only did script work on the first half . Luna Eclipsed , HWE are two I had a heavier hand in-- also Lesson Zero . Ca n't remember which others.Q : How was working on Cats Do n't Dance ? A : AMAZING ! I was 21 , non-jaded and in love with my first job ! <p> Lauren Faust Interview for Equestria Daily <p> 1 . Hello , Lauren . Thank you very much for agreeing to this interview and for taking the time to talk with Equestria Daily . Let 's begin then . First , let 's discuss the steps that led to the creation of My Little Pony : Friendship is Magic . When and how did you first cross paths with the My Little Pony franchise ? <p> When I was 6 , I saw the first large and brown " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a typical horse-obsessed little girl already , but I liked tall , graceful thoroughbreds and Arabians , so the pudgy pony was n't quite as interesting to me . But when they came out with the multi-colored ones , I could n't help but reconsider . They were too darn cute and I just I had to have the Pretty Parlor with Peachy , my first little pony . Then , when Hasbro came out with the unicorns and pegasi , there was no going back . Horses and fantasy ? I kissed Strawberry Shortcake and Barbie goodbye , and soon , I was spending every penny I was given or earned on collecting every pony thing that came out . <p> 2 . Did Hasbro contact you regarding a leading role in their new Friendship is Magic reboot of My Little Pony , or did you approach them ? What did they present in their case to you ? <p> I had approached Hasbro to pitch a micro-series pop opera for my Milky Way and the Galaxy Girls project , and it prompted Lisa Licht from Hasbro to ask me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me one of the recent DVDs ( Princess Promenade ) and asked me to watch it to see if there was " anything you could do with it . " They wanted a reboot , and she was really pushing to match the right talent with the right project . Hasbro was just coming off the success of the Michael Bays first Transformers movie and Lisa was interested in finding similar " creative stewards " - talent that would re-invent and lend their unique voice to their other properties . The possibility of this sort of creative trust and freedom and Lisas belief in this approach really piqued my interest . <p> 3 . Following up on that , why did you decide to spearhead the show ? What factors secured your interest and confidence in the high quality and wider appeal of Friendship is Magic ? <p> At first , it was just because it was fun and easy . I had played with the toys for most of my childhood , and I literally referenced the characterizations and stories I made up for myself when I was little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely on the personalities I gave certain toys . Many of the locations where expansions of the MLP playsets I played with in the ' 80s . I used to say that my own inner eight-year-old was my personal focus group . <p> And beyond that , my confidence in the project grew as the more work I turned into Hasbro , the more they said " yes ! " Developing animation for TV is often ( though not always ) a grueling and disappointing process , and you can end up miles away from your vision . I 've known people whove directed their own pilots while no longer knowing what they were trying to say or who their characters were after having it developed to death . I did n't  want to be in that position . I was also so passionate about making quality entertainment for girls , and I did n't  want to be responsible for adding to the pile of entertainment garbage that 's so often targeted toward them . I was always waiting for things on MLP to take this sort of bad turn during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hasbro was kind of awesome that way . <p> 4 . So , you signed on as developer and creative director of MLP:FiM - but even you could n't do it alone ! You needed a team of talented , dedicated , and creative individuals to surround you and bring this universe to life . What measure of independence did Hasbro afford you in choosing those professionals - producers , writers , artists , animators , voice actresses , composers , and so on - that would end up working with you toward the goal of creating this fantastic cartoon ? Any particular people with whom you were able to reunite from previous work on Powerpuff Girls and Foster 's Home for Imaginary Friends ? Any particular people you were able to bring on board with whom you 'd always wanted to collaborate ? <p> The development of this show and the greenlight to pre-production were just about exactly one whole year apart . While developing the concept for the show , I personally produced a 40+ page " pitch bible . " I was hired to do this on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help I wanted with the budget I was given . I hired two artists to help me with this early phase . Martin Ansolobehere , with whom I had worked on Powerpuff Girls and Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends , did some adorable initial background concepts for this bible . And my friend Paul Rudish , a key creative for shows like Dexters Laboratory , Powerpuff Girls , Samurai Jack , the first Clone Wars and Symbionic Titan , assisted me with conceptualization and art development . In particular , I remember an amazing sketch he did of pegasi romping across clouds to make it rain . This inspired me to come up with the concept of the ponies controlling the weather and otherwise being stewards of their world . He also came up with the initial version of Nightmare Moon . Paul is a creative powerhouse , and I felt very fortunate to work with him . This version of the bible consisted of art by Martin , Paul and myself , and I did all the writing . <p> A little after the bible was first presented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I hired Dave Dunnet and Lynne Naylor . Daves first background designs ( colored by Martin ) all made it into the show and became the defining reference point for the art direction . Lynne designed the final Nightmare Moon and Luna . And of course , my husband Craig McCracken listens to me gripe , pontificate and bounce around ideas about whatever Im working on , so his influence is spread throughout . <p> Once the bible was finalized , with main and side character designs and descriptions , locations , and general world dynamics , Hasbro then started interviewing several production studios . DHX ( then Studio B ) was one of them . I was impressed by the animation in Martha Speaks ( they made Flash look like traditional , and their animators were adept at animating four legged animals ) , and I was impressed with the energy , humor and overall direction in Pucca . So , when Studio B pitched that they wanted Jayson Thiessen to be the supervising director , I felt very confident that they could do what I was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and I made a two-minute short to demonstrate what the show could look and feel like - and sometime later , Hasbro secured Studio B to produce the series . <p> Once the show was greenlit , I was able to hand-pick my writing team ( with Hasbro and Hubs approval ) , most of whom I 'd worked with on Powerpuff or Fosters . The rest of the artistic team was put together by Studio B and Jayson . Jayson endorsed Ridd Sorenson as art director , and I approved him . Voice actors and composers were all auditioned , Jayson and I endorsed our picks and Hasbro and the Hub made the final calls . There were only a couple picks we disagreed on , but obviously , it all worked out great . <p> 5 . In the pre-production planning process , who brought about most of the decisions regarding the format and layout of the show ( 2D Flash animation in 22-minute episodes ) ? During this critical stage , how much of the show 's conception was due to the team at DHX Media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ franchise and content ? <p> I pushed for Flash and Hasbro trusted me . I wanted 22 minute episodes , but briefly the plan was for 11s . Ticket Master was actually the very first script and was written before the show was greenlit , and it was originally 11 minutes . Hasbro changed its mind eventually - I cant remember why . I was glad . I prefer 22s . <p> By the time pre-production began , I had the concepts for the show already nailed down in my finalized bible . I had finished development , which included the characters , their personalities and designs , main locations , tone , several premises and three scripts - I had them all ready to go . <p> Once we were greenlit , the Studio B team was brought on and it was less about developing and more about MAKING the episodes . I went up to Vancouver to meet with the team and give out initial direction . Ridd and his designers then started expanding on the art direction and Jayson and Wootie started building the astounding Flash builds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were doing that , Rob Renzetti and I started the script process with our writing team in LA . Hasbro was pretty amazing at trusting us , which was fortunate because we were going so fast . The only changes that Hasbro made at that time were visual tweaks to locations that had playset potential and changes to some of the names of locations and side characters to make them more " salable . " <p> 6 . Excitement must have been building as the show 's ideas finally began to coalesce ! What were the primary challenges in this phase ? Any particular innovations or epiphanies strike the crew as the show transitioned from planning to the first stages of execution ? <p> For me , the primary challenges were 1 ) The schedule - literally twice as fast as any production I had worked on before - and 2 ) being separated from my crew . I was in LA working alone from my home office , while everyone ( except the writing team ) was in another country . In these crucial beginning stages , ideally you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from day to day to keep the vision cohesive - no one can see what 's in your head , and with so many artists , you can get a lot of different styles , ideas and approaches . Its up to the showrunner to pull it all together ... and its really hard to do over the phone and email , and to do it twice as fast as you 're used to . I felt so fortunate to have Jayson and Ridd in Vancouver . It would have surely been a huge mess without their expertise to guide the team to achieve what I was looking for . All the work , when done , was sent to me via the Internet for notes , revisions , and final approval . There were times I would have liked to have just walked down the hall and talk to an artist about revisions , but I had to do it all via email , which took longer and lacked the luxury of back-and-forth . There was a lot of trial and error to work through in the beginning , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I could n't just tell people what I wanted to see . <p> Another challenge was meeting the perceived needs of our young target demographic . We had to figure out how to make the more adventure-y shows compelling and exciting without being scary . It took some extra thought and a combination of careful storytelling , lots of jokes , and appropriate , appealing designs . Tone adjustments helped as well - like lightening a scary situation with humor and whimsical design , or making an otherwise non-threatening scene more tense with art direction , music , and proper timing . <p> Similarly , there was also worry about seeming mean - and I do n't  mean cruel or dastardly , I mean slightly rude or mildly insulting . We had EI ( Educational and Informational ) standards to adhere to , and character behavior that was considered OK in shows I 'd worked on previously was suddenly considered " inappropriate for children " in My Little Pony . Something as mild as Rainbow Dash calling Twilight an " egghead " in Fall Weather Friends was treading a very delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheating was worrisome to some . It was tough to find humor and create character conflict within these very constricting boundaries . <p> The biggest innovation , I feel , is the animation . Jayson and Wootie delivered far beyond my expectations and have done things with Flash I thought was completely impossible . I used to put notes on storyboards that said " revise staging , this is impossible in Flash " and theyd write me back all " no , we can do it " and they did . Also , I feel the art direction was an interesting innovation in that most shows aimed at girls are overly bright , garish , oversaturated and plagued with waaaaaaay too much pink . I think the colorists achieved something that is definitely feminine , but unique in that it is still extremely appealing , pleasant , and devoid of cooties , if you know what I mean . ; ) <p> 7 . Tell us about some of the major contributors at this point and throughout the show 's run . Jayson Thiessen was the supervising director for Season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As supervising director , what was his primary responsibility , and how did the chain of production run from Hasbro through you to Jayson and the other leaders ? <p> Rob Renzetti was a big contributor , and , of course , Ridd , Jayson and Wootie . Rob and I handled all of the story development and scripts down in Los Angeles . Once they were done and approved by Hasbro and The Hub , we 'd get them recorded , and hand them off to Jayson and Wootie to begin the production work . Jayson would supervise his team in Vancouver and send me the work at each phase ( design , color , storyboard , animatic , animation rough cut ) for direction and/or revisions and then make sure my revisions were put in place . Each of these phases would then go to Hasbro and The Hub for any further adjustments . <p> 8 . Rob Renzetti has contributed to many cartoons over the past two decades - including 2 Stupid Dogs , Dexter 's Laboratory , and his own My Life as a Teenage Robot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as story editor , and how did that writing process flow between top decision-makers ( such as you and the folks at The Hub ) and the actual writers and Rob ? <p> I was so thrilled when we got Rob on the show ! He s extremely talented , and having run his own show in the past , very experienced and knowledgeable . Rob and I came up with and wrote all of the story premises . Once approved , Rob and I decided who to assign each script to and spent a whole day with the writer , just the three of us , planning the story of each episode together . The writers started writing , Rob and I gave notes and sometimes did revisions at each phase ( outline , first draft , second draft ) . Then the outlines and scripts went to Hasbro and The Hub for notes , further revisions and final approval . If the notes from Hasbro and The Hub were light , usually Rob handled the revisions himself . Once approved , the recorded scripts were sent to Studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sarah Wall is the producer of Friendship and Magic and other DHX Media productions . What roles did she and the other DHX leaders play in the creation of Friendship is Magic ? Similarly , what aspects of the show 's first season drew chiefly from crew suggestions ? <p> Sarah manages the day to day production , budget , and schedules ; and she and the production staff made sure the artists got the material they needed when they needed it . Im amazed at the work producers do ; its so much to juggle . <p> As for crew suggestions , we occasionally held " writers summits " in LA ( though I wish we had had more ) to brainstorm new premises . In the writers room , many of the script writers came up with and defined new characters . There were also many board artists and designers in Canada that had a certain way of drawing expressions or body language or hairstyles or outfits that further defined the way the characters looked and acted . These were constantly compiled and referenced as production went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's art director . What elements of the show 's design drew from your initial sketches , from Ridd 's direction , and from Hasbro 's specifications ? How much did the design and style of the first season change from initial conception to final production ? <p> The initial BG design treatment from the show came from Dave Dunnet . We were fortunate to be able to bring him on for the two-part pilot to design many of the main locations and the ruins in the Everfree Forest . I designed all the main and supporting ponies and Spike , and they were not changed from the bible . Beyond the pilot , Ridd and his team developed the style even further under my supervision . I continued to do a lot of the character designs in the beginning . All in all , I do n't  feel the art direction really changed all that much after development , it just continued to evolve and get more refined . <p> Hasbros input came mostly when a location had potential to be a playset . Raritys Carousel Boutique was revised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were working on a toy they wanted to have featured in the show . The hot air balloon was introduced this way . Often theyd ask for a location beforehand , like a schoolhouse , so we could design it first . They were pretty great about letting us decide how to use these locations in context of the story so it did n't  just seem to come out of nowhere . <p> 11 . Daniel Ingram and Will Anderson compose the wonderful songs and music found in abundance throughout MLP:FiM . Could you describe how you and the rest of the team coordinated cues , goals , and ideas with Daniel and Will ? What transpired between the producers , writers , and Daniel to bring the ponies ' songs to such vivid life ? Similarly , how did you and the top decision-makers work together with Will to infuse such lush music into FiM ? <p> Whether or not a story warranted a song was decided in the story meeting . In the writers room , Rob , the writer , and I would plan what information needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tone the number should be . Then it was up to the individual writers to compose their own lyrics for the songs in their scripts . Once the lyrics were approved ( usually along with the whole script ) , Daniel came in . I would give him some brief direction at the start - then hed come back with an initial recording ( usually with a temp singer ) . He would sometimes make small adjustments to lyrics to suit the music better . I do n't  recall giving him many notes that were beyond tweaks , except for when we had to ask him to make the Cutie Mark Crusader theme song WORSE - poor Daniel ! But it was an essential story point that their performance was legitimately bad . Once all was approved , he produced the final records . <p> Will and the score came later . Once the animation rough cut was done with the final timing and editing , I would meet Will at his studio ( he is also in LA ) , and Jayson or Wootie would call in through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " spot " the episode - directing Will on what kind of cues we want to hear and when . It was a very collaborative process . <p> 12 . Friendship is Magic is a labor of love brought about by hundreds of devoted individuals , and we fans truly appreciate the efforts and handiwork of each and every person who has done any sort of work on both the show itself as well as its exemplary wellspring of promotion at The Hub . As such , we do not want to exclude anyone from our outpouring of thanks and genuine support . However , in the interest of highlighting crew teams and processes that might otherwise go largely unnoticed , could you expound upon any facet of the show 's creation and production that benefited Friendship is Magic beyond the readily obvious results ? <p> At any given time , a designer would design a side character in a direction I had n't  thought of , or a board artist or an animator would add a gag or a character trait that would help define the show further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the characters that you would never imagine without them . Its an ongoing , organic process - and everyone involved contributes to the evolution of the world . As with any show , it was a very collaborative effort . <p> 13 . Thank you very much for all of your insight thus far . If you do n't mind , Lauren , I 'd like to transition from discussing the show 's conception and structure to exploring the timeline of the first season itself . First of all , in your estimation , how long was the time period from conception to production and from production to debut ? How many episodes was your team managing at one time , and why did you and DHX stagger and juggle them the way you did ? <p> One 22 minute episode took almost a year from conception to completion . A final show usually aired about a month after it was delivered . There was an agonizing point in the schedule where we were literally working on all 26 episodes of season 1 at one time - and , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many as 32 at once . <p> Staggering episodes is , as always , the standard production process . You have to stagger the episodes to make sure everyone is working . For instance , when a character designer is done with episode 12 , we cant fire them and hope they 're still available when episode 13 is ready . Episode 13 needs to be ready for design right away , which means the script needs to be done , and script 14 needs to be ready just one week later . Its very much run like an assembly line . A new episode had to begin every single week to keep the process running , so everyone on the team had work . Its especially trying on those of us who are supervising all aspects of the show . On any given week I was coming up with a premise , calling notes on an outline , calling notes on a first draft , revising a final draft , revising designs , recording and episode , revising a storyboard , calling notes on an animatic , spotting music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivering the final episode . And each of these steps was for a completely different episode . On most productions , this is actually a 2 week process , but we had to make it work as a 1 week process . I 've never worked on a schedule so fast . <p> 14 . What were some of the greatest triumphs you experienced during those precious first stages of actual production ? Likewise , what were some of the most difficult obstacles to overcome ? Which elements turned out unexpectedly better or worse than initially estimated ? <p> There was skepticism and concern about the art direction in the opening sequence of the pilot . Some people thought that having the series begin with such a different look would turn viewers off . I love the look and feel of that sequence . I was so glad to keep it . <p> The characterizations of Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash were a worry to some as well . It was thought that Rainbow was too boyish and our target audience would n't relate to her , and it was also thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even a lot of debate and concern over Applejacks accent . I spent a lot of time trying to reassure everyone that they would be lovable characters . In the case of Pinkie , once everyone was finally comfortable that she was n't annoying , we got to make her as zany as I had always envisioned her as the season went on . Its a testament to Hasbro that they put their faith in us as they did . <p> What came out better than expected , as I mentioned before , was the animation . It turned out far better than I had ever dreamed . When the first walk and run cycles were sent to me for approval , I fell out of my chair . And Daniel Ingrams songs were grander than I ever imagined . The voice actors made authentic stars out of the characters . Tabitha St. Germain , for example , added a humor to Rarity that was unexpected and wonderful . <p> Its hard to point to anything coming out worse , at least not in the beginning . The first few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's to be expected . It always takes a few episodes for a crew to hit their stride . Any disappointments I have at that stage are only in specific details - certain character designs that I did n't  love , some jokes that fell flat , etc. , but nothing consistent enough to be worth mentioning . <p> 15 . The season began with a two-part introduction to Equestria , unfolding the tale of Twilight Sparkle 's journey to Ponyville and her triumph over Nightmare Moon with the help of her newfound friends and the virtues represented in the Elements of Harmony . Afterward , the season continued to hold a certain level of continuity but meandered from story to story as a episodic romp . Why 'd the approach change , and how did this impact production and creative input ? What do you believe emerged as the strongest component of the new direction ; alternately , what do you believe you could have accomplished had the show stayed on its first course ? <p> This is a good opportunity to clear up a bit of a rumor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interesting Internet game of telephone ; consequently , a lot of fans now seem to think that I had a grand scheme for a big , dramatic , serialized magical-girl style of a show . Actually , it was always my intention to have the show partially " adventure stories " and partially " relationship stories , " as I called them in my initial pitch bible . I had thought that maybe a third of the episodes could be more like Dragonshy , or the end of Feeling Pinkie Keen , or even have this creepy thread through them like Stare Master . But , ultimately , fewer than a quarter of the episodes had this adventure aspect to it . There were several reasons why . For example , restrictions on what was considered too scary for our younger demographic put limitations of the types of stories we could tell . The accelerated schedule also made it difficult - plot heavy episodes take too long to plan , and too many new characters and locations were a heavy burden to the crew at such a fast pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have fallen short ; and since we had a cast and crew that was so well versed at comedy , it just seemed like the right decision to de-emphasize that style . <p> I do n't  think the consequences of this minor change in direction were really felt in Season 1 except for the quantity of the types of stories . The tone or humor would not have been different , and the expectation that we could start going in that direction in later seasons gave me hope that I could still fulfill some of the characters ' grander destinies ; but , truly , I always wanted this show to be an ensemble-cast comedy first and foremost . <p> If we had penned more adventure stories , the only difference I can think of is that perhaps you would have seen more of Luna and Zecora . Zecora was designed to be a sage and mentor to whom the ponies could go for information about their quests . She was designed to be a second mentor to Twilight , but that did n't  come to pass . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with darkness and night - and these are considered ( by some ) to be iffy themes for a show for young girls - so she had to slide to the wayside . <p> 16 . Thanks for clearing that up ! Here 's hoping it dispels some of the idle gossip about the intro arc . Now , at the heart of the show are its well-designed and endearing characters - indeed , the show has differed slightly from previous incarnations by choosing to focus on chronicling the escapades and developing the personalities of six main ponies ( plus Spike ! ) . How did the team 's ambitions drive the construction of the main cast and their excellent compositions : fantastical yet relatable , strong yet flawed , caring yet selfish , appealing yet imperfect ? <p> I doubt any team of writers sits down and strategizes whether or not to have good characters or lousy characters . Everyone wants good characters - just , not everyone can execute it . We had a great team who could . Not to toot my own horn , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch bible . I literally wrote the characters with their " good traits " and " bad traits " described in their introduction . The writers took these ideas and ran with them in the scripts , the actors with their voices , and the story artists and animators with their expressions and posing . I kept tight watch , especially in the beginning , to make sure all this input was cohesive , pushing and prodding when needed . For instance , I encouraged people to keep the wacky gags exclusive to Pinkie . I cleared some of the initial confusion about how to make Fluttershy and Twilight funny , and Rarity needed special care to keep her from being the typical shallow debutante character . I created these characters , and I felt the need to protect them . <p> 17 . Your body of work demonstrates a zeal for character-driven media . What have you seen in your career that compels you to champion and create this style of media , and why do you pursue your specific dreams and aspirations ? In short , what does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I champion character-driven stories and humor because character-driven stuff is just what I like to watch and what I like to do . I think making your audience experience an emotional reaction is the core of good storytelling , and you cant evoke emotion without likable , relatable characters . Some shows focus on gags and written jokes and have an exclusive goal to get laughs , but I prefer comedy that has a sincere emotional core ... and humor that comes from characters , not one-liners . Somehow , its just a bit of a strength I have . <p> My specific dreams are still to make great entertainment for girls . I just do n't  think there 's enough truly good stuff out there for them , but I also have kind of selfish reasons . When I think of something I want to say or an experience I want to share , my ideas are usually innately feminine because I 'm female - and I refuse to believe that something being feminine by nature automatically means it is n't worthwhile . If I can put the tiniest dent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " for girls " equals " crappy , " I 'll be very satisfied . <p> 18 . The ponies are definitely the heart of the show , yet they occupy a world that is rich with mythology and fantasy while still sporting a variety of modern technology . What was the creative strategy behind constructing the realm of FiM 's Equestria ? How did the team approach this balance between mythological fantasy and modern tech ? <p> I always wanted the default technology of the show to be a bit medieval in nature ; but since this is a whimsical , non-serious show , I felt there was plenty of wiggle room . I think ultimately it was just my personal comfort level in each individual story . If it screwed up the story to get too technical about how primitive the technology was , it was n't worth it . So , if we needed cameras , I just wanted those cameras to be relatively workable to a creature with no fingers . And if we absolutely positively HAD to have an electrical appliance ( which we often did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some magical unicorn mechanic at some point . However , I insisted that such an attitude was to be considered only as a last creative resort - do n't  use a light switch when you could use a candle , just because you 're feeling lazy . Do n't  draw a hoof unnaturally and awkwardly wrapped around an umbrella because you do n't  feel like thinking about it a little more . Overall , though , it was definitely not a strict approach - and its hardly consistent . Humor and ease of storytelling took precedence over technicality . <p> 19 . Seems to me that a lot of foresight went into the creative planning process . Apart from the new episodic direction , how often did long-term plans change during the course of the first season , and what were the primary reasons for any major shifting ? <p> There was a lot of planning in development and a lot of planning for the animation process in the beginning - but really , at a certain point , once production was in full swing , we were kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as we went along . We had to rush to get stories approved and into production . I actually regret that there was n't more time for planning and fine-tuning . <p> 20 . Wow . All of that must certainly have been taxing - but I can assure you that the end result has been unquestionably worth it ! What were the most rewarding aspects of creating the first season , and why were they so fulfilling ? <p> For me , it was amazing to see all these ideas I 'd had for years and years about how to make compelling stories for girls come together . So much of what is in MLP is what I 've been trying to get on the air since I started in TV . It was amazing to see it actually work and people actually like it . <p> 21 . I imagine that level of success elicited quite a large volume of feedback . Were any particular strengths or concerns frequently mentioned in letters and other responses you received ? <p> By far the most common message I received was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you done to me ? ! " ; ) Ive received a lot of notes from men in the military who are fans of the show . That 's been a wonderful surprise ! I 've also received many messages from people who say the show has helped them through depression , which is truly touching . And I really love when I get letters from dads who say its their favorite thing to share with their daughters . Another favorite , common note is from young female artists who say the show has inspired them to write their own stories or pursue a career in animation . <p> 22 . Describe how the various media reports impacted your direction and outlook , if you would . At first , several outlets were noticeably caustic , owing either to insufficient information or simple misunderstandings . More recently , the level of positive coverage from the media has been trending sharply upward . What do you make of all the articles - both positive and negative - and why do you suppose that the general perception has changed , beyond simply increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job in the first place , I expected that the usual " ew gross , girls ! " response was inevitable . I even expected that people would actively hate it without even watching it . So , when the first uninformed , unjustifiably negative articles surfaced , I was disappointed , of course - but not surprised . I just thought of the girls whod finally have a worthwhile cartoon to watch and tried not to worry about the folks we werent targeting . I knew ( or at least I thought I knew ) we would n't sway their biases no matter how great the show was . <p> 23 . You did well in that ! Of course , any discussion of My Little Pony : Friendship is Magic would be shortsightedly incomplete without targeting the most incredible online phenomenon of 2011 : Bronies ! I 'm a brony , Lauren - as are scores of thousands of other teenaged and adult fans of MLP:FiM . First off , how and when did you and the team first learn of the brony phenomenon ? How closely did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Oh gee - I feel old to admit I did not know about 4chan until I was checking comments on an episode that had been put on YouTube . Someone pointed out that people were freaking out about the show on 4chan , so I moseyed on over and WOW - was I surprised ! I checked in regularly ( strategically ignoring unsavory material as best I could ) and pointed it out to some other members of the crew . Then came Equestria Daily and Ponychan . I could n't believe how the fandom was spreading - or the amazing creativity that was coming out of it ! It was just such a FASCINATING turn of events , and I was simply riveted . <p> 24 . What aspects of this brony phenomenon took you by surprise ? How did it impact the direction of the show and morale of the crew ? What were the most encouraging aspects of this newfound fanbase - conversely , what logistical difficulties accompanied our advent ? <p> Just how it kept growing and growing and growing and how it seemed to inspire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceases to amaze me . I think the surprising fanbase invigorated the crew and kept us going when we were getting exhausted . There 's no better morale booster than making an actual impact . I cant say it affected the direction of the show beyond crossing Derpys eyes , however . All of Season 1 and the opener for Season 2 were written and underway in production by the time the brony phenomenon took hold . We could n't change anything at that point . <p> 25 . The Hub television network has earnestly been reaching out to us in the recent months . What 's your take on primary vs. peripheral demographics ? How did you seek to unify the two , and what do you expect will be the standard moving forward ? Put succinctly , how do bronies affect ponies - in our purchases , discussions , fan works , and the rest ? <p> While we were moving forward on Season 2 , we all felt that we attracted this audience with the strategy we laid out to attract girls and their parents - so we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least as far as the show is concerned . If it ai n't  broke , do n't  fix it , right ? However , even outside of bronies , I was hoping that some of the " nicey-nice " restrictions would be lifted for Season 2 or that wed at least get more wiggle room . Not because I had a need for edginess , but because I thought we were going to start running out of ideas to explore within those restrictions . <p> 26 . Thanks for all of your answers so far , Lauren . We truly appreciate your candor and willing communication with us . As this Q&amp;A draws to a close , could we touch upon a few lighter topics before we conclude ? First of all , the four EqD blogponies - Sethisto , Cereal Velocity , Phoe , and myself - are all extremely grateful that you agreed to this interview . How closely do you follow Equestria Daily and other major pony fan sites ? <p> I will admit I still check in on EqD almost every day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I consider them very valuable resources - and , frankly , fun ! I also admit Ive occasionally contributed to discussions , and Ive even dropped a few spoilers for fun - yay for anonymity ! I totally lurk , guys ... so careful what you say ! ; ) <p> 27 . Wow , thanks much ! ( And how clever of you ! ) How about the rest of the fanbase - fan art , music , videos , and the like ? You and several other FiM crew members have been very active on sites such as deviantArt and Facebook . This high level of communication and interaction with the fanbase has been unfailingly valuable , and we most certainly appreciate it ! How often are you able to keep up with all of the pony fan output - and would you like to say a few words to those who create it ? <p> Not to disappoint , but I 'm afraid I do n't  read fan fiction - I just do n't  have time , and I do n't  want the accidental influence . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the YouTube mashups . There is some talent out there that completely floors me . <p> 28 . Thank you so much , Lauren - believe me , we all sincerely appreciate your support ! Now , once again , new horizons are spreading before you - horizons as yet unknown to the rest of us . As much as you can , without giving anything specific away , could you tell us what we can expect from Lauren Faust in the months and years to come ? What 's the next move for you , and how - and , more importantly , why - are you blazing that trail ? How have ponies shaped your philosophy and outlook moving forward , and what do you expect will be your single most poignant and lasting memory from your time as the watchful shepherdess of the pony herd ? <p> I have a lot of irons in the fire right now , and I 'm waiting to see which one shows the most promise . It is still difficult to sell animation for and/or about girls , but MLP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People did n't  even believe girls shows could be legitimately funny and that boys might actually watch them ... yet , between Powerpuff Girls and FiM , there 's proof that lightning can struck more than once . <p> The most lasting effect working on this show will have for me is the literal ' dream-come-true ' facet of the opportunity . Not only was it a chance to bring one the most inspirational aspects of my childhood to life in the manner I had dreamed it could be since I played with ponies as a child , but it was also a chance to put my theories about entertainment for girls into practice . Seeing it work so well that it brought in an additional , unexpected audience was a triumphant bonus . However , what will also stick with me is the sadness I felt when I realized I had to leave it . It was a horrible , painful decision . It still stings ... and I suspect it always will . <p> 29 . We 'll definitely miss you moving forward , Lauren . Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you expect Friendship is Magic to end when it inevitably ( and unfortunately ) does ? What do you foresee taking place in the final episode ? More personally , how would you like to see the show end when it inevitably ( and unfortunately ! ) does ? What would constitute your ideal final episode ? <p> Not to give a disappointing answer , but - as I wont be involved , I do n't  know how to expect the show to end . I had my own ideas for an end to work towards , with certain characters fulfilling specific destinies . Only some of those plans were well-formed , though ; others , I had hoped to work out as the series progressed . I 'd rather not share what my plans were at this time - it will diminish what the new people in charge ultimately do . Plus , it just really bums me out that I cant do them . <p> 30 . Stepping back and viewing the larger picture , how do you perceive this show has shaken the stereotype of a young girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step toward portraying that media in an intelligent and positive light , but a large stigma nevertheless persists . In your estimation , what 's the next step - and what else must be done before that detrimental stereotype can begin to fade into irrelevancy ? <p> I think the show may have opened the minds of a number of specific individuals , but I do n't  think its influence is really far reaching enough to make that big an impact - yet . Ill be curious to see how the attitudes of the young girls and boys who enjoy the show grow as they do . Perhaps having enjoyed the show will make them less resistant to similar content as they grow older , and perhaps it will inspire them to create similar things . <p> Next steps are just to continue in this direction . Networks and studios need to be willing to give feminine concepts a try , the people who can make this kind of stuff need to be given more chances , and audiences need to put their preconceived notions aside and give female content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea that liking something feminine is belittling . I think that last one is the tallest order of them all . <p> 31 . How do people such as bronies factor into this situation ? What distinctions between a " boys/guys " show , a " girls/gals " show , and a " family " show should and should not exist , to you ? Why do the current distinctions exist , in your mind , and how can people such as the teenaged and adult MLP:FiM fans influence executive and marketing mindsets toward these programs ? At the root of it all , is the " divide " between the genders dwindling ever smaller - and what will it take for males and females to be equal as humans ? <p> I love the idea of " all ages " entertainment - media that is enjoyable to male and female , young and adult . But the perception currently out there is that , if the main character is a girl , or if a significant portion of the cast is female , it is " for girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is planned for both genders , it means most of the characters are boys - and that maybe , if you 're lucky , there are a couple of girls who get to tag along . I long for the day that female characters are not considered novel . <p> At the same time , its hard to ignore the evidence that some specific content will attract mostly women and girls and that other content will mostly attract men and boys . I think that 's okay too - not to mention fun . The problem is the positively ancient issue that a girl will watch a show or a movie about a boy - but a boy wont watch a show or movie about a girl . The people who profit from media need to protect their investment , and they know theyll get a larger audience and make more money if they default to " for boys . " It remains the most common reason why girl stuff is n't made . <p> The only thing that will change this is support . The audience supplies the ratings and the profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you like a show involving girls , watch it and buy the stuff . Spread the word , refuse to be ashamed , ask for what you want , and visibly support artists who do it well . All of this encourages the people with the money to give this kind of content a chance . <p> As you said , the divide between the genders may be dwindling ... but the gap , in my opinion , is still large . If you look around you , people still insult boys by comparing them to girls ( " pick up the pace , ladies ! " ) and praise girls by comparing them to boys ( " wow , you draw as good as a guy ! " - to quote what someone once said to me when I was a student ) . The question of what it will take for everyone to consider the genders equal is way too big a question for me . I have no idea . But I think its up to everyone as an individual to carefully and honestly evaluate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better - if only in their own lives and the way they treat people they know . <p> 32 . Thank you so very much for taking time to answer all of these questions , Lauren - and for spearheading the magical cartoon that is My Little Pony : Friendship is Magic . We love it , and we love you too . To you and the rest of the FiM crew : Thank you all - so immeasurably much . This concludes the Equestria Daily Season 1 retrospective interview with Lauren Faust . On behalf of everypony , I wish you the absolute best . If you 've any final thoughts or comments , Lauren , please share them with us . <p> Just a great , big , extremely sincere thank you to everyone who watches the show ! This kind of fan reaction is the sort of thing every artist dreams of but does n't  dare believe can actually happen . I always worried that , despite the late nights and work-filled weekends - the blood , sweat , and tears ( well ... not blood ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go almost unnoticed , as many shows do . You guys make it all worthwhile , and I cant thank you all enough . 
@@77556060 @6256060/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> Depression and sadness is a harsh truth of life , one that comedic shows do n't  often want to address . We usually think a character is sad in our headcanon , but the last season appears to be experimenting with the theme of depression with a few characters , both old and new . Let 's talk about depression and how it was conveyed in Season 5 after the break . <p> Usually in cartoons , a character who is depressed or sad is n't affected by it for long . We even have examples in previous seasons of MLP . " Party of One " focused on Pinkies mental disconnection for the latter half of the episode , while " Pinkie Pride " also dealt with the existential sadness that came with being challenged at what you feel is your talent . In a way , we 've had these thoughts about certain characters brewing in the background for some time , as fan and headcanon answered questions that seemed to be lost to time or Hasbros desires . But nothing broke this idea more than " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've said in my past editorial on Princess Luna , the canon around her was shrouded in mystery because the backstory and pain that came with her banishment and culture shock upon coming back is hard to address for the target audience . " Luna Eclipsed " scratched the surface when it came to the Princess depression , but focused more on her reputation , which had n't  been changed even though Luna had been reformed for a while . It makes sense that while Luna made some friends in Ponyville , it was n't enough to drag her out of the pit . <p> " Magic Sheep " did n't  need to focus its entire episode on the creation of the Tantabus or the nightmares that take place within Lunas mind . The mere revelation that Luna has been slowly poisoning herself with the Tantabus is a dark thought . Not only was Princess Luna depressed , but she was doing this damage to herself due to her guilt over something that was out of her control . While it can be hard to empathize with a character who takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the allure and confusing aspects of depression : it is n't logical . A logical pony would reach out to her friends or sister for help or emotional guidance , or consult a therapist to try to get on the path of self-acceptance and forgiveness . Creating a Tantabus is something that a depressed ( or character suffering from depression ) would do . <p> My second example is Moondancer in " Amending Fences " . Her predicament is indicative of the emotional trauma that could come with having your hopes and dreams shattered at a young age . Much like Starlight Glimmer , Moondancer was so scarred by Twilight missing her birthday , that it sent her on a self-destructive path for a few ( canon ) years as friendship became paltry to her . She ignored her mane , avoided simple improvements to her life by disconnecting from her friends , and even grew emotionally " numb " until she yelled at Twilight in Act 3 . <p> While Starlights path became destructive to Equestria , Moondancers life became a cycle of boredom and mediocrity . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than to learn . The beauty of life and living it is the fact that anything can happen , especially when you are more outgoing and have the desire to reach out to others . By going to a club or park with a friend , you could end up meeting your future lover , or a different friend that you could have for life ( much like Twilight did with the Main 6 ) . Instead , Moondancer pulled herself away from those chances . While she was n't in a downward spiral , her life was linear and would n't improve without Twilights help . <p> Finally , " Appleoosas Most Wanted " aimed at addressing a different symptom of depression : a lack of self-esteem . While the episode is n't going to receive an Emmy anytime soon , Troubleshoes giving up on finding out the true meaning of his cutie mark can be a gripping and emotional 22 minutes . The fact that he gave up and instead believed that he was the talentless epitome of bad luck is a problem that depressed people can relate to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art or writing because of low self-esteem . Life kept pushing Troubleshoes down , and he had no desire to get back up . After the Cutie Mark Crusaders showed him how to apply his talent in the right ways , his self-esteem came back and he accepted his clumsiness as something he had to work on . Instead of thinking that life was out to get him , he realized that he could follow his dreams even if he was n't the best clown in Equestria . Those who write and are dyslexic or paint while being colorblind can relate to his struggle . <p> We do n't  expect these stories to be the sole focus of a narrative , even if " Amending Fences " happened to perfectly convey Moondancers heartbreak and Twilights uncomfortable position of being the Princess of Friendship that lost a friend . We expect a characters sadness and depression to be brushed over or fixed once the credits roll , but each ending is not so cut-and-dry . My Little Pony walks a very tight rope by having each characters problem seem finished by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better themselves when the " camera " is n't on them . Much like how Princess Twilight has grown over the years , she did n't  suddenly become a mare or mature once she got her cutie mark or wings . I could argue that she is n't fully mature , and not because there 's another season coming . We never stop learning , and I 'm sure Princess Twilight would agree . <p> I want to make it clear that I do not know or claim to know everything ( or even anything ) about depression or sadness . Both of those words are broad and often misapplied . We all get sad or depressed at times , but the cyclical slog and self-destructive behavior of Moondancer or Princess Luna is beyond what we would call " a bad day " . Season 5 has learned how to tell these stories over the years by remaining subtle or ambitious , whatever the episode calls for . " My Little Pony " has turned from a show where a shooting star as a sign for Applejacks parents is the deepest they could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that caused it . These are ideas and concepts that are way harder to convey to both the target audience and us bronies , those that might not have a glimpse into what depression or long-term sadness could be . For all intents and purposes , the writers succeeded in telling these stories . I cant wait to see what themes they will be playing with this year . <p> What do you guys think ? Do you think that some of these characters have a form of depression ? Are there some examples of depression in Season 5 or before that I missed ? Leave them in the comments . Thanks for reading and I 'll see you all next week .

@@77556065 @6256065/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> Illustrious Q is as surprised as I am . Hasbro recently unveiled a new toy line called " Guardians of Harmony " , which looks to bridge the gap between boy and girl merchandise . We as a fandom have been slowly looking towards Hasbro to release toys that did n't  always have a brush taped to the cardboard , so what does this mean with this new series ? Let 's talk about cross-gendered toys and what this could mean for Hasbro and the fandom after the break . As usual , a video is at the bottom . <p> Let 's face it , not a lot of people were going to expect the bronies to last this long . This rings doubly true for Hasbro , who seem to be as disconnected as they can be from the fandom . Its DHX and the staff behind the show and comics that tend to give us the shout-outs . While we will probably never have public numbers that state how much money bronies spend on the toys , I 'd imagine that parents and little girls have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the reason Hasbro has released these toys ( apart from the obvious answer that is increased sales ) is that they have allowed their licensees ( Funko , 4DE , Enterplay ) to dip their toes in the water over the past few years with an ever-expanding amount of " for everyone " products . Weve seen Hot Topic vinyl figurines sell out , while the Trading and Collectible Card Games have expanded over the past two years . " Slice of Life " premiered to overwhelming praise while the comics and even the Season 5 finale have experimented with darker themes that Hasbro would have struck down years ago . <p> All of these new ventures had the chance to bomb , and they did n't  . Hasbro is not in the business to sell ideas or art or something that 's esoteric . If they were , then " Littlest Pet Shop " would n't have been cancelled . While I want to avoid characterizing this new toy line as " a reaction to the bronies " , the appearance of a boy in the promotional pictures as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " type of design seems to point towards a reaction to something . There 's usually a bunch of factors that correlate to and cause this type of reaction , but again , Hasbro has the sales charts and data , and we do n't  . <p> I severely doubt that Hasbro is debuting this toy line for any other reason than to sell toys , but that does n't  make me ungrateful for what they are doing . I think of it much like the comics and vinyl figures : they 're expansions of what weve previously had . " Guardians of Harmony " can fail just like " Littlest Pet Shop " . The question that should linger in the back of Hasbros ( and all of our ) minds should be whether or not this decision is ahead of its time . <p> " Guardians of Harmony " can be as ground-breaking as it wants to be with both design and advertisements , but funneling a bunch of money into an idea is not going to promise its sales . People from outside the fandom still question me about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me wonder if the general public is going to write off all of these awesome designs as " girly " merchandise ? I 'm not positive on how someone shops for their younger girl or boy , but if these new Spike and Shining Armor figures are in the same aisle as the other Equestria Girls merchandise and pretty pink brushable ponies , then will this toy line be disregarded by the average shopper ? <p> With Targets stance to remove gender labels on toys and Hasbros ( apparent ) desire to have diversified toys bought more often , I ca n't be positive that the cultural standards behind " boy " and " girl " toys are being shattered or even challenged enough for " Guardians of Harmony " to be economically viable . The comics ( or other branching media ) for the toy line could bomb or be uninteresting , which would cripple the bronys desire to buy the toys . A competitive replacement for this toy line could debut ( such as a new Transformers generation ) and dampen the Spike figure sales . There 's a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk for Hasbro . <p> Only time will tell if " Guardians of Harmony " will reach out or interest enough people to stay in circulation . I will certainly be buying a few when they debut just because their designs look visually appealing to me . These figures have the chance to be a mainstay in the toy aisle , alongside Equestria Girls dolls and vinyl figures at Hot Topic . Hopefully they sell well , so that we can get even more awesome poses and cannons next year . <p> What do you guys think ? Is there a market for these types of toys ? Will you buy these toys even if the comics for this line are unappealing or bad ? Leave them in the comments below . Thanks for reading and I 'll see you next week .

Names given not just to a cosmic ball of gas but also for its effects on a world of thinking creatures . Would Celestias name rank among them ? What about Luna or Twilight ? These alicorns , are they the most powerful of ponies ? Are they avatars of the world or gods incarnate ? <p> Join me , We Are Borg , after the break in Part 1 of The Goddesses of Equestria for a look into the theology of a polytheistic Equestria or the apotheosis of fandom made gods . <p> So , I always start with the basics , so let 's go over Collins Dictionarys definition of a " god " : <p> " a supernatural being , who is worshipped as the controller of some part of the universe or some aspect of life in the world or is the personification of some force " <p> An easy enough explanation as any . So does Equestria have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and modern religions of various beliefs , practices , and deities . Throughout history and today there are many cultures and religions that practice a polytheistic , or multi deity religion , and many others that celebrate a monotheistic religion , belief in one all powerful being such as Christianity and Islam . Well known mythologies of Greece , Rome , and Egypt ( apart from others ) , and currently practiced religions such as Hinduism , all have many gods and/or goddesses for the Sun , Moon , love , fertility and other forces of the world . Some gods are described as more powerful than others . They are often described as immortal , avatars of the world , omnipresent , all knowing , and keepers of life and death . Throughout this article I will look into the evidence as it could be interpreted for how the alicorns of Equestria meet the definition and descriptions of being goddesses . So let 's start with knocking out the basics ... <p> Well , going back to that god definition , it kind of describes Celestia and Luna , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supernatural . While pony magic is common enough among all ponies , the Alicorns embodiment of all three races of pony and the power they contain , certainly makes for an above average creature . Weve seen some rather impressive magic come from the alicorns including maintaining a shield spell the size of a city for days Rarity as well , no , not the drama queen , is also a quality of supernatural , so with only four five alicorns in existence , that requirement is met . And it almost goes without saying that Celestia , and certainly Luna , are controllers of some part of their world ... <p> Is moving the Sun with a horn like using a Wiimote ? <p> To note a story in The Art of Equestria book , Lauren Faust tells of colleague who , during a brainstorming session , drew a picture of a pegasus jumping on a cloud and creating rain . This gave her the idea of ponies being " stewards of their own world . " Ponies raise and lower the sun and moon , change the seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control the weather as if planetary physics had ceased to exist . This theme evolved to be a core concept of the show , and was first introduced in the series pilot . While some fans may argue that the first episodes were rough , the dialogue unpolished , and the exposition poorly handled , a great deal of information about Equestria and its ponies and alicorns was shared . Upon entering the Everfree Forest , Applejack describes the environs as unnatural and that it " do n't work the same as Equestria " meaning the plants , animals and weather get along without pony meddling . <p> So does this flip our god definition on its head ? Controlling aspects of the world was supposed to be for supernatural gods only , not literally everypony . Well , were still in the clear . Celestia , Luna and even Twilight and Cadance have unnatural power and talents compared to everypony else . While in the days before a unified Equestria , a group of unicorns would raise the Sun and Moon , Celestia can do both herself and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponies limited by their cutie mark and talents , the alicorns seem boundless in their power . <p> Since before Twilight became an alicorn in the show , fans have explored the idea of her apotheosis and the power , the responsibility , the possible immortality and all the good and bad that goes along with it . One of the big questions regarding the fledgling alicorn is will she outlive her friends ? After all that is one of synonyms of a god : Immortal . Despite reassurances that that wont happen by Meghan McCarthy , that leaves us wondering if the Princess of Friendship will have a normal lifespan , will all the mane 6 become alicorns , or was that a placating answer because the show will never get around to her death ? Regardless of the mysteries surrounding her life span , we do know of some ponies who have lived an extremely long time : The Princesses of the Sun and Moon . <p> With a 1000+ years under their saddles , these two equines have not died , have not aged , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they appear to just grow larger . The ultimate question is are they truly immortal or can they live forever ? Well some cultures do n't  make that difference and in fact have had gods that have died , usually killed by other gods . Regardless , with all the things they have locked away in Tartarus or imprisoned in stone , youd think one of them would have gotten a lucky shot in . And maybe they did ? What did Chrysaliss desperately cast mega laser do to Celestia ? Knock her over . Now granted we are dealing with a kids show so maybe we could n't have gotten it any other way . And yeah Bug Face did get the upper hand , but we ca n't expect Celestia to get all Sol Invictus on someone in the middle of a crowded wedding .

One of the prerequisites for reincarnation ... is dieing . Weve seen pony teleportation since the pilot and we 've seen teleportation to alternate dimensions , and those indeed look magical and effect filled , but what happened to Twilight in her library was something else entirely . Five terrifying beams of Equestrias most powerful artifacts blew her away , leaving nothing but a smoldering pile of pony dust and the smell of burnt hair . She was stripped of her mortal coil and existed only in a place the likes of an Alicorn can go . But while the spell was the catalyst , Celestia was right there waiting . She gave Twilight the book of Starswirl , she let her keep the Elements at the library , she was prepared with a song , and ignited the spark inside Twilight to continue the job . The white alicorn was not surprised , or concerned . She was expectant and proud . In the end , it was Celestia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the path to becoming an alicorn as surely as she knew the Twilight was the element of Magic and gave her new life .

Why did such a massive portion of the brony fandom fall so far while other things have thrived ? <p> Let 's dive into it ! We will start with a bit of history , work our way into what it 's current status is , and what we can do to make it better in the future . <p> ( Skip to the bottom if you just want our response to the music feedback ! ) <p> Brony Music - The Beginning <p> Since not everyone out there was around way back in the early days , let 's take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of you probably already know from previous history posts , much of the fandom we have come to know and love today was inspired by the massive insurgence over on 4chan . Fanfiction , art , and more was already being produced before EQD even arrived . <p> We probably would n't have a music scene at all if it was n't for the show itself producing such catchy tunes . Daniel Ingram dropped some excellent mini-beats that were easy to pick up and build from . One of the first major breakout hits on the music side was Eurobeat Brony 's " Super Ponybeat - Evil Enchantress " . It 's debated if this started the swarm , but many quickly latched on to the idea . <p> With the success of remixes , came the flood of original , pony inspired stuff . Songs from people like Iamnotacleverpony gave unexplored characters themes that people listen to even now days . In true fandom style , ponies were being matched to just about every genre out there . <p> That 2011-2013 period was an absolute explosion . Brony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran into these crazy kids getting millions of views on Youtube for remixes My Little Pony of all things . A quick look at some of the earlier musicians is pretty telling on how well they are doing on the subscriber scene thanks to that early boost from cartoon horses . It seemed like just about anyone skilled in the art of music could get a massive following with pony . <p> So why did something so huge , end up becoming so difficult to break into ? <p> The 2014 Slowdown <p> After years of being a juggernaut of entertainment , things were getting a little bit overwhelming . If you read the comments on the suggestion post , many people ran into the exact same issue we did- there was just too much ! I still remember a night years ago in the middle of 2013 , when we had four music posts in a row with 3-5 songs in each . It was getting to the point where everyone and their little sister was slapping ponies on top of something they made on their ipad in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality tracks people spent weeks on were getting drowned out , and the audience as a whole was growing bored . <p> This killed a lot of people 's love of the scene . The ease of making electronic music , and the mass pirating of programs to do it meant just about anyone could make a convincing techno track to your average listener by combining a bunch of samples together , clicking some buttons , and essentially automating a song . Using these same samples and beats over and over inevitably resulted in loss of interest . <p> On EQD , we tried something we saw some success with on the fanfic side , and recruited a team of music quality inspectors ( mainly the big names in the fandom ) to help weed out the good from the bad . Daily Skype chats would meet up and discuss the list , picking and choosing what should and should not be posted . The review was tiring , and the flood quickly overwhelmed them . Eventually it just moved to a text based channel , with a daily list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We saw people give music a second chance for a while with the increase in quality requirements , but even the high end gets old after a while . It began to decline , and new , learning composers just could n't find a place with us only posting the best of the best . To help alleviate the review process , we started the Music of the Day post . It was essentially a " training ground " for brony musicians , with the goal of getting some of the new , less practiced people a few views and feedback to hopefully improve them over time and shoot up to that star-level the original crowd reached . <p> It 's still unclear if it had any effect . The biggest problem was simply burnout . It 's hard to differentiate yourself from fellow electronic musicians , and over time , even acoustic , rap , and other traditional styles saw a drop with how many hopped on board . <p> Where Are We Now ? How Can You Help ? <p> ( Welcome to the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do we do ? What are the major issues ? What can EQD do ? What can YOU do ? <p> Unfortunately , this is something that is hard to combat . The only thing we could potentially do is make things even more strict for spotlight to really highlight specific tracks and make music posts slightly less common , but we 've already attempted dropping them to 2 songs instead of 3 when possible . There is still a lot of good music being released these days , and we do n't want to stifle potential great stuff just to make people crave music more . <p> Too much of the same genres over and over <p> This is another hard one . With the age of the internet unleashing the concept of indie musicians on the world , pony in particular has been hit hard . Thousands of music makers have come and gone over the years , and there really are n't that many ways to set yourself apart with a limited number of genres to choose from . There does n't seem to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition ? I wonder how many would enter that ? <p> Lack of originality <p> Pony is an old fandom , and we are n't getting many fresh eyes . When an old crowd is bombarded with similar things over a period of time , they start to get desensitized to it . It really just boils down to the points above here . Every once in a while these days , we get a major breakout hit that sets itself completely apart from the pack . We could probably learn from what these tracks do . <p> Confusion on what " Music of the Day " actually is <p> This is a big one , and one of my greatest fears when starting Music of the Day . When mindlessly browsing the internet ( we all do it ) , it 's easy to not know what something really sets out to do . We put countless warnings on early incarnations of these posts saying the tracks within were not the same as spotlight posts , and that it was mainly a second chance training ground deal , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day is not for the best of the best . It was a place where we could put tracks that might not be as original ( or original as we could get ) , well mixed , or perfect as we 'd have liked in the main spotlights . It was meant to give new people a few views and feedback . Like all things though , over time it has gotten absolutely flooded and less people are willing to give it a chance . <p> This is another hard one to fix . We ca n't just stop taking the 10-15 songs every day/other day that enter it , but it 's difficult to give them exposure without further augmenting the problem . Any suggestions here would be awesome . EQD is , and always has been a huge learning experience in a " template " that does n't exist for us . Feedback is what we need here . <p> New musicians not rising <p> For those that did n't know , Mandopony was creating Chiptune songs way back before the Elements series that really skyrocketed him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the one section I dislike the most . I see awesome creators like Synthis , 4everfreebrony , Vylet pony , and others lacking the explosions that I loved watching people like Mandopony and The Living Tombstone go through after a few spotlights here on EQD . All of those early musicians started off at about the same place these others did , with similar talent levels , but when many more eyeballs were seeking things out in ponyland . It 's a shame to not see this happen anymore just due to a musical attrition . <p> This is where you all come in ! Take a few minutes each day and check out the newer guys we post up . Every view , subscribe , download , etc helps motivate them to keep going and improve . Provide constructive feedback like you gave us . If you did n't like how something was mixed , let them know ! EQD 's ability to make people popular has always been in your hands . We just post em and filter the good stuff ! What do we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I would like to see about doing : <p> Musician interviews ( Popular and unpopular both ) <p> In-depth song analysis <p> Album reviews <p> Improved spotlight posts with better blurbs about each song <p> Music events <p> The big problem we run into here , is the lack of music " writing " skill here on the EQD staff . It takes a specific type of language to pull that off . We may be looking for someone experienced in this , but as with most volunteer positions , we ca n't work them too hard . <p> Feel free to pick some of those points out that you 'd like to see in the comments ! <p> Where are we at in music ? Where do we go from here ? How can you help ? <p> As with many things Brony , it 's not too far-fetched to say we are completely unique in terms of how huge the remix and music scene got . No other fandom has created literally thousands of songs about a single topic in such a short time . Whether this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the jingles in the show fueling it , nothing has ever come anywhere near what we did , and continue to do . <p> Other new nerd-culture hits are trying the same thing . Undertale and Five Nights have some excellent fan-made productions . Many pony musicians have migrated into these to help fuel it . But even with that already massive injection of talent ( and Youtube subscriber base ) , they are n't sparking nearly as much as pony did without that central hub helping new people out . <p> The brony fandom is heading into it 's fifth year , and while we do n't have the viral madness we did in 2013 ( especially during these hiatus ) we are still , BY FAR , the most productive group of geeks out there .

Regardless , a hundred episodes is a significant achievement for any show . <p> Rarely , though , is it a love letter . <p> Quite a few years ago now , on a cartoons and comics board of an imageboard site that has no different of a reputation today than it did then , the first frames of this new show by a very well-known cartoonist appeared and sparked something unique , if not unprecedented . As always with such things , after a certain point they begin to take on a life beyond what their creators envisioned . An animation error was spotted for a brief moment in a crowded scene . The commenters named this horse , wrote stories about her , and grew attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pairs of horses seemingly always paired together in the background , and made stories about them , too . A pony with a particularly unique style always drew attention , even though the show was never about them . <p> Their brief moments in the spotlight sometimes carried over into their being an integral part of the undercurrent of community that spawned around these personal small horses . Though the captains of the good ship My Little Pony certainly knew about them , they kept their acknowledgement of them to a minimum , almost always for the best . <p> Once in a while , though , you can jump the shark and it 's okay . The boat will keep sailing . <p> Followups on Equestria Daily have always been about pointing out funny things in the background that you might now have noticed the first time around . They 've grown a bit since then , but now we really get to go back to the roots . <p> Just in case you were n't sure who helmed this episode . It 's sort of hard to miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuity ! It 's a ... hell , if I have to say that every time , I 'll be late for the season finale . <p> That said , I rather like their second take on Der- I mean , Muffin 's voice . It sounds smoother and more natural , though I did n't really have an issue with Tabitha 's original performance in The Last Rounderp . She did a stellar job this time , too . <p> She 's still Derpy to me , though . <p> I du n no , I 'm having trouble placing this reference . It 's a hard one . <p> Maybe the rest of the episode will provide more clues . <p> I want this as a sticker . I will pay actual money for this . <p> No , wait , this . <p> No , wait , this . <p> I 'm having the hardest time not taking a screengrab of everything Derpy does in this scene . You can tell the animator was having either a lot of fun or was silently banging their head on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We love you for it , really . <p> I 'm pretty sure I read a fanfiction like this once . <p> I 'd ask if it 's weird to have your cutie mark on commercial merchandise , but we have those saddlebags . <p> Yes , I am aware it 's not a panda , but if I did n't include that line I 'd never hear the end of it . <p> I actually found this line about being the best organizer before Twilight rolled into town a little bit sad . I want to think it 's commentary on the effect the main cast can have on things they do n't expect , but I 'm probably reaching a bit . <p> Derp . <p> Having the flower sisters fainting at the slightest thing was one of the smallest throwbacks they added , but you bet I appreciated the heck out of it . <p> Obligatory Lyra and Bon Bon . <p> The animators wasted zero time getting these two into a pose . <p> Also , voice style= " Cinema Sins " misleading bedroom eyes. /voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are an inordinate number of ponies that just take monster attacks as a regular occurrence and just roll with it . <p> Wait . <p> Wait , hold on .

Then , a page turn later , the recipe calls for driving to Wisconsin and finding a spectral wolf to lead you to the Arc of the Covenant . <p> That 's kind of what happened in this scene . <p> I love it . <p> This little dance was adorable , but I 'm still not sure who this pony is supposed to be . <p> This one rivals Derpy in how far back it goes .

It's- <p> Oh , I get it , that 's the joke . <p> Obligatory Octavia and Scratch . <p> I 'm really alright with Scratch being the Teller in this pairing . I think the decision to never have her speak makes this interaction all the better , even if it is , in the end , just a shoutout . <p> The kind of shoutout you need earplugs for , but , y'know . <p> " She DO got da booty .

@@77556089 @6256089/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> Another glorious season is behind us , and as with all good things , some liked specific aspects of it better than others . 26 episodes aired , but only 10 can be the best of the best ! <p> We ran a poll last week and the results have appeared . Instead of us choosing , we are letting you choose ! Luckily most of our favs were right up there with yours . DHX kinda knocked it out of the park this season , so the competition was fierce ! <p> Anyway , I 'll stop blabbering so you can see more blabbering below . Head on down below the break for the top 10 pony episodes of season 5 ! <p> ( Reminder : These are community voted ! Blame your fellow brony before attacking me : P ) <p> #10 - The Cutie Map <p> After the most ridiculous year long hiatus ever , and half the fandom temporarily switching to Five Nights at Freddies , there was a collective sigh of relief when we FINALLY got pony episodes again . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a brand new antagonist and her creepy little cult village giving us a big juicy steak after months of 50 cent ramen packets . <p> Starlight Glimmer charged in with a literal World War 2 inspired propoganda song , followed by full on 1984 level indoctrination . It set the stage for what kind of boundaries the show can stretch as we moved on to 24 more episodes . <p> #10 is a healthy spot for this one , and I 'm glad it made it . <p> #9 - Make New Friends But Keep Discord <p> Discord episodes have always been about completely shattering anyone 's hopes that things will go smoothly , and " Make New Friends but Keep Discord " was no exception . The return of The Smooze from G1 days had a lot of us eager to see what happens . They took a completely different approach , and I 'm glad it worked . <p> I think my favorite part of Discord episodes is his banter against Twilight . Throwing chaos against order is always going to be entertaining , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix for the hippie fans out there was a good touch , even if she ended up being a bit on the obvious side . More characters to play with is appreciated . <p> Overall , I definitively expected it to be in the final selection of the best of the season , and you all did n't fail me. #9 fits perfect . <p> #8 - Tanks for the Memories <p> I actually thought this would rank higher . Maybe it 's just due to how early it happened ? Tanks for the Memories was sort of that point where I knew I 'd love this season . I 'm not a huge fan of Rainbow Dash episodes in comparison to other ponies , but this one shifted gears and focused on an entirely different subject than her usual competition driven trope . <p> If you have ever had a pet , you know how much it sucks to lose them . It 's inevitable . This was as close as we could get to it in pony . <p> Add an awesome song to it , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episodes yet ! <p> #7 - Rarity Investigates ! <p> Rarity got a TON of love this season , all back to back . She revisited Coco Pommel , opened a boutique in Canterlot , and saved Rainbow Dash from a life of being shunned by her idols . Usually these fashion focused romps are n't the most well loved of pony showings , but this one definitely set itself apart with the plot . It 's no surprise that you all gave it the #7 slot . <p> Would you watch an entire series dedicated to detective Rarity ? I kinda wish she 'd give complete control over her growing fashion empire over to Sassy Saddles and just focus on this . Complete with the costumes of course . <p> Seventh place it is ! <p> #6 -Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep ? <p> Airing right after an army of background ponies suddenly got canon personalities and an entire episode dedicated to their shenanigans , the guys over at DHX dropped this bombshell on us giving our fandom creations even more love . this was the perfect one-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second half of the season . Derpy giant derped , Lyra and Bonbon FRIENDSHIPPED , and Big Mac was a princess . <p> It 's a Moonbutt episode first and foremost though ... and wow . How far do you have to fall to literally torture yourself every night ? Luna kinda took Emo to a whole new level with her Tantabus . Who would have thought her pain cut so deep ? <p> I 'm honestly on the fence when it comes to this version of her . The silly variant that plays living chess with her subjects in the comics is more my style . I 'd love to see a bit of that in the show . Outside of Luna Eclipsed , we still have n't gotten to watch her awkwardly adjust to modern Equestrian society . <p> The Tantabus resolution worked in the end though , and the overall episode was solid enough for a #6 slot thanks to your votes ! <p> Anyway , pony got itself a professional broadway singer for one of the most well-loved feels songs we have seen the show so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , we got a bit of cute Applejack backstory and Coloratura herself spawning a 31 image strong dedicated art post 24 hours after her debut . I 'd say she was pretty popular . <p> Some did dislike how quickly the episode moved , arguing that it felt more like a celebration of having such a talented singer on staff as opposed to a fully fledged plot , which is probably why it 's down here in the #5 slot . Regardless though , I 'm probably not going to be the only one with " The Spectacle " and " The Magic Inside " on a playlist long into the hiatus . <p> And butt veils are cute . <p> #4 -Amending Fences <p> I 'm not going to lie . This was my #1 . I 've watched it at least 10 times just on the side while doing various EQD duties . Everything from Minuette being adorable to Moondancer promoting the ultimate feels ; it was just an all around excellent episode . <p> The fandom reaction was pretty interesting too . There seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you are an extrovert , it may have not been that big a deal . Moondancer would probably be kind of alien with that mindset . Introverts could relate though ! Nerd Glasses pony is our spirit animal ! I kinda wish I did a poll on that looking back . <p> A well deserved #4 , and if you are like me , probably higher . <p> #3 - Slice of Life <p> This one was no surprise at all . In one fell swoop , DHX and Hasbro went all out on celebrating a huge amount of what the pony fandom has created over the years . Lyra and Bonbon became BEST FRIENDS , Derpy and Dr. Hooves did SCIENCE , Octavia and Vinyl performed a concert duo , and the fandom collective exploded . <p> An entire essay could be written to explain why this episode got the accolades it did , but you are probably sick of words already by now , so let 's stop stating the obvious and dive into the next one . <p> #2 - The Cutie Remark <p> Usually I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right after a season . Typically the finale always ranks higher compared to some of the early episodes just due to how fresh it is in people 's minds . I 'm not 100% sure if that effect took place here , but there is no doubt that we had an awesome finale this season . <p> Five years ago , I never would have expected something like this to happen in Ponyland . It 's our perfect utopia with happyness everywhere right ? Imagine my surprise when we got an entire World War 2 style section , a much more aggressive changeling vs. pony invasion , and a straight up wasteland . Depression-ere misery in ponies is n't something we are used to . <p> Is this a good thing for pony ? It 's open to interpretation . On one hand , we now have a much more realistic world that has the potential to be just as violent and dangerous as ours . On the other , I do kinda miss that " utopian " feel Equestria tends to have . Or at least " better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , but it has been largely peaceful . I even wrote an editorial on that . <p> Anyway , there was no doubt that this episode was awesome , which reflects it 's current poll standing at #2 . I guess the popularity of Fallout Equestria was a testament to what we like to see all along . <p> #1 - Crusaders of the Lost Mark <p> What a way to end the saga of the Cutie Mark Crusaders chasing their butt tattoos ! There are several layers of " that bitchy character no one really likes " , and for four seasons , Diamond Tiara was right at the bottom . I rarely saw anyone love this filly . Her every word has been the epitome of douchebaggery since her first appearance way back during Call of the Cutie . Nothing could possibly salvage this tiny pink monstrosity right ? ! <p> Four awesome songs says I was WRONG ! <p> Diamond Tiara is now TOP tier foal status . Pony took that usual trope of " killing the character everyone hates off in a GLORIOUS fashion " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad for and love the character everyone hates " ! In the end , Spoiled Rich was the real demon causing this little filly to embrace her element of assholery , and I ca n't wait to see her lose horribly on that poll over on the side bar . <p> Oh , and the CMC got their marks . <p> While I still lean toward Amending Fences for my personal favorite of the season , there is no doubt that this one resonated most in the fandom . <p> Though , her " command ponies to do things with money " cutie mark destiny is a little weird . <p> HONORABLE MENSION : Trixie 's Lost Episode <p> It is true . Trixie was seen only once this entire season . This is not due to a dislike of the character by the writing staff though . On the contrarty ! Trixie had an entire 3 episode arc dedicated to her amazing magic . It turns out she teamed up with Sunset Shimmer ( HOOVES version ) to start a brand new magical school with Luna 's blessing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ponies from other countries and cultural barriers , a look into the Great and Powerful Trixie 's tragic past , and finally an epic climax where she joins up with Moonbutt as the princess of MAGIC . Turns out Twilight going friendship mode left a gap in the elements or something . <p> Too bad none of you will ever see it . I can confirm , it was awesome . <p> That 's your top 10 ! As mentioned above , you all chose these , so do n't hate me if your favorite was n't here ! <p> If you want the rest of the results along with exact numbers , check out the poll here . <p> Be sure to hit the side bar for the currently running , 3 round best of season 5 character battle ! 
@@77556090 @6256090/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> Well , it took 94 episodes , but here we are . I do n't know how many of you expected to ever see Gilda again , but it happened , more than four whole seasons later . <p> I 'm Pegasus Rescue Brigade , bringing you my first episode followup of the new season . This week , veteran writer Amy Keating Rogers brought us an episode featuring a whole lot of heart , one of the oldest minor characters in the entire series . <p> Let 's talk about " The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone " after the break . <p> So , we started off this week with what I thought was one of the most adorable cold opens we 've seen in a while : Pinkie and Gummy baking together . Or at least , to the extent that Gummy can be considered to be doing anything with anypony , ever . <p> I 'm beginning to wonder if there 's a dragon somewhere in the highest boughs of Pinkie 's family tree . <p> I 'm pretty sure this little guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes I wonder if he 's really just a stuffed doll or something , and any lifelike characteristics he exhibits , much like the inanimate objects in " Party of One " , are simply a figment of Pinkie 's imagination . <p> I think I read a fanfic like that once . <p> We 've seen this happen enough times now that I think it 's reasonable to assume Pinkie Pie uses the same hair-care product that created the Mane-iac . <p> " Tiny denizens of Griffonstone , I am your god now ! " <p> One thing that I immediately noticed a lot of fans reacted to was the amount of worldbuilding in this episode . A griffon kingdom has been speculated about for a long time , and this sequence delivered to us not only a canon setting for it , but historical details to back it up . <p> Plus we got some really cool storybook art for these histories . Kudos to the animators for exploring different styles when the opportunity arises . <p> " Dear Princess Celestia , today I learned important princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y'know Pinkie , Twilight 's writing is just fine , but her art needs a little work . " <p> I think I read a fanfic like this once , too . <p> " We 'll take the lot ! " Are there any chocolate frogs among those treats , Pinkie ? <p> This screenshot is here because of cute hats and creepy smiles . I do n't actually have anything to say about it . <p> Top quality followup I 'm doing here . <p> Conspiracy time : Twilight knew Griffonstone was a dump but is required for political reasons to make it sound awesome . Being a princess must be tricky . <p> And then , the dramatic moment ! Gilda was our very first minor antagonist , beating out even Trixie by a single episode . Personally , I was n't desperate to see her reappear , but given the circumstances , I was excited to see her show up again . <p> Some of the fans were n't , though . A few of you really hold a grudge when it comes to someone bullying Fluttershy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tension working yet ? How about now ? Now ? " <p> Seriously though , following up on what I just discussed , Pinkie actually amazes me with her ability not to hold a grudge . Gilda has literally never been friendly to her , and she 's still all smiles . <p> Somehow , the appearance of this guy 's house and his general attitude makes he wonder if he 's half cuckoo instead of half eagle . <p> Gilda 's heard this story once or twice before . <p> This monster immediately caught my attention , and the attention of a lot of other fans who know some details about older generations of MLP . He bears enough similarity to Grogar from generation one that I adaptation of the character . As far as I know , he 's not , but maybe one day we 'll see him appear as well . Tirek and the Smooze managed just fine , after all . <p> The Abysmal Abyss ? Ghastly Gorge ? Is it some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with alliteration ? <p> " Do you have a caption for this screenshot ? " " Do you have enough bits for one ? " <p> This is going to be one weird wave of shipping art and fanfics . <p> The fact that this sign needs to exist is hilarious . Spontaneous musical numbers are much funnier when the characters are aware of them occuring . <p> " Tell me where the baked goods are right now , dang it ! I need my fix ! " <p> I like how Pinkie 's mane contributed to the indentation , not just her body . <p> Once again , her exact choice of hair-care products are called into question . <p> These few seconds must have been incredibly interesting to animate . Pinkie goes through a hoofful of totally bizarre faces in just a few moments . <p> " I 'm smiling because I have really good dental coverage . " <p> Gilda does not understand this whole " Jazz Hands " thing . <p> You can almost hear the synapses struggling to send a message , <p> Poor Dash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looks like she 's a pegasus in need of some kind of rescue brigade , huh ? <p> Get it ? Because ... <p> Yeah . Moving on . <p> Unfortunately , instead of that , she had to settle for Pinkie Pie . <p> Gilda was never a character I associated with " heart-attack-inducingly adorable . " Times sure do change . <p> It 's interesting that griffons start out with wings the same size as a pony 's . Gilda 's wings are much bigger than Dash 's now . <p> You know , even though we heard this chant ages ago , and were fully aware that Dash and Gilda used to chant it at flight school , it still really hit home with me to see it happen here , mainly because the version in " Griffon the Brush Off " was so insincere on Gilda 's part . It 's the kind of joy you can only experience when you 've settled for a cheap knockoff for a long time before suddenly being given the real thing , like how all toys of Princess Celestia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctly colored ones . <p> Somewhere around this moment , I realized something . Dash shrugged off Pinkie 's suggestions on how to help Griffonstone and went off to do her own thing . Later on , Pinkie dove into an accursed canyon and faced basically certain death in order to try to save her friend . <p> Which one is the Element of Loyalty , again ? <p> Really ? We 're making this reference and Daring Do is n't here ? <p> " Fluffy " and " Delicious " are now terms that can be legitimately used to describe friendship , apparently . <p> Or something . I 'm out of jokes already , Good thing we 're almost done . <p> New headcanon : griffons have extremely powerful vocal abilities . Gilda did n't even yell very loudly here , and she still blew Dash and Pinkie 's manes back . When she actually yelled in earnest earlier in the episode , Pinkie left a Pinkie-shaped dent in a stone wall . <p> Forget the beaks and talons and catlike speed and agility ; griffons can probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming a lot . <p> " I 'll always remember you , Pinkie Pie . " <p> " Oh , do n't be sad , King Grover . We 'll be seeing a lot of each other in the fan content real soon ... " <p> I have to admit I 'm disappointed that there was n't a finished , perfectly crafted fifteen-layer cake next to Gummy in this scene . <p> It must still be in the oven . Yeah . That 's it . <p> Well , that 's all there is to say about this one . Stay strong for that three week hiatus , guys . Episode 100 is next , and I have a feeling all of us are going to have something to discuss about that one .

Throughout the conversation , we found that Hasbro had no problems with the film itself , but other factors that could be damaging in the long run . In hopes of trying to ensure the films release , my legal adviser and I came up with a solution so that Hasbro would feel more comfortable with the films release .

There is no doubt that the fandom , as we know it , has changed a lot since the massive surge in 2012 . Pony was a 24/7 thing for almost a year and a half , dominating millions of lives !

Look at how important that sounds . <p> The Fandom 's Peak ! <p> Let 's start this off by looking back at where we came from without digging as deep as the fandom history series . There is no denying that 2012-2013 was our major fandom peak . This was that point in time where it was essentially " the thing " to rock a Rainbow Dash avatar on your favorite message board or gaming service . You could n't go three links without running into someone with a pony . The internet was amazed , and geek culture groups everywhere wanted in on it . Hot Topic had an entire pony section filled with stuff flying off the shelves . <p> These days , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . A lot of the people that hopped on just to be in on the new cool thing have moved on in terms of their everyday internet usage . Geek culture stores have dialed back the pony flood to specific collectables . <p> This was all expected though.With how much there is to choose from in terms of digital entertainment , the trend followers have shifted to other " new " things , and My Little Pony 's current following is primarily built on the true fans that will be here for the long haul . The difference between Friendship is Magic and other fandoms is how giant the remaining , active collective is . We still rock 30-40 pieces of art A DAY here on EQD . I do n't think many other 5 year old fandoms can come anywhere near that . <p> And at the end of the day , a lot of those people that " moved on " still return for major events . There is often a joke about never getting off the ride when it comes to pony , and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects , and more tend to cause a whole bunch of people to come out of hiding . Just look at conventions . A lot of major online friendships only meet up once a year at BronyCon , even if the members of a group are no longer super active in online pony . Friendship really is magic ! /corny/ <p> The Creators <p> Content creation has always been the fuel that keeps us going between episodes and during giant hiatus . Without them , we probably would n't exist . As I mentioned above , this side of the fandom is still going incredibly strong . There have been a lot of major names over the years that take long breaks and return sporadically , but the core , ever-changing collective still releases things constantly . <p> Analysis : <p> Over the past year and a half , an entirely new section has arrived in the form of analysis , giving people who may have lacked the artistic skills to fit in early on a way to break out . It 's going through the same growing pains as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part it 's thriving on astronomical levels . People like Silver Quill and KP have huge followings , and new people are slowly gaining a voice every day . We are getting to that point where the gold rush is slowly stabalizing , but I would n't be surprised if a few other fresh charismatic video makers do n't join the 50k+ subscriber ranks . <p> Audio Books : <p> Fanfiction has always been huge , just look at the juggernaut that is Fimfiction . The new , rapidly growing subset is the pony audio book . With services like Audible spamming every podcast imaginable this past five years , and the increasingly mobile world that ca n't find the time to sit down and read , being able to wander with a book playing in your ears is perfect for entertainment . Pony is all over it . We recently opened up to separating them from their usual place in the Nightly Roundup here on EQD . <p> Oldschool Subjects : <p> I 've already mentioned that art is still thriving . This is one a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fandom " dying " . Over the years , we have seen loads of big name ask blogs and comic artists disappear , but they are typically quickly replaced . The newish blog " Horse Wife " is a good example of what can happen when you nail that niche people are looking for . Is the slumbering side of the fandom strict on what it will latch on to ? It always has been . But with the amount of stuff we see made here , it 's inevitable that people will be more critical on what they will follow over time . A lot of people came back from pony breaks to visit Brownie Bun and her husband every day . <p> The Music Scene : <p> This is the final one I want to touch on with the creation side , as it 's brought up more than most . It 's no secret that having that giant base of early-fandom subscribers continues to make specific musicians dominate , and grow far past what they were when simply sticking to pony . Subs and views these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time investment in exploring it . With things like art or comics , a quick scan will confirm if you like or dislike someone , but with music , you really need to sit down and give a song a shot . <p> Of all the topics , music has definitely reached furthest in terms of fandom expectations . We still see people break out and get the subscriber swarm that helps them grow , but it 's rare . A lot of genres have been done to death , and people like to stick to who they know . Some amazing new musicians that would have dominated in 2013 are n't being given a chance , and it 's a bit saddening . The best thing you can do is hit up those spotlight music posts , or if you are feeling brave , grab the playlist at the bottom of Music of the Day for some that did n't quite make the main series here . Comment on their pages , comment on the EQD pages , give people some feedback . It 's the best way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So , Is the My Little Pony Fandom Dying ? <p> For part one , let 's end on the final question people constantly bring up . Is the fandom " dying " ? Hell , I just discovered that if you drop " Pony Fandom " in Google , it auto-completes to that very question . People are worried , and it 's perfectly natural to be . A lot of us have made some amazing friends here , and I do n't think any of us would be around if we did n't love the ponies . " Dying " really is n't the right word though . <p> I pointed out above that a lot of people essentially hibernate on pony these days . Do n't get me wrong , there are a LOT of strong , 24/7 pony communities here on EQD and beyond for , but a good amount of people enter and exit based on what is currently happening . The entertainment overload is real , and the concept of " Fandom " has never been stronger with how easy it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities in all of their interests . When one is in hiatus , AKA pony last year , they bounce to something else and return when it returns . <p> The best indicator here on how strong the fandom still is , probably centers around the convention scene . While no longer growing exponentially , they still pull in more numbers than the previous year in many cases . That hibernating side of the fandom is more than happy to dedicate a weekend or three to all out pony . And the massive core base that is always here welcomes them back with open hooves . <p> Pony is n't dying , it 's just celebrated differently than the peak in 2013 . We have seasons all the way to 2017 confirmed , with a giant movie that will probably spark an even greater surge . I would n't worry too much !

Despite the surprising success of MLP , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what they think make money ( and they do n't want to spend much to make it ) . If I have to make it a show , I 'm not going to make it until I can make it good--- so it may not get made . <p> Additional question to above : <p> Q : What would the show ( Galaxy Girls ) be like , if it ever gets made ? Epic adventures in space , or slice of life comedy , or something different ? <p> A : Thematically , I was planning on making it a lot like MLP--- slice of life + fun adventure--- just in a fantasy , story-book version of space . But I put a lot of those ideas and themes and characterizations in MLP . If I move forward with it at this point , I would like to completely redesign the characters . I kind of hate the way they look right now . I drew that stuff almost 10 years ago . <p> Q : I too , wish to know what Lauren Faust thinks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but from what I gather , they are exploring some interesting themes . <p> Q : Why did n't Hasbro just request a Galaxy Girls show to sell something to compete with Monster High ? Were they high or something ? <p> A : No large company wants something they ca n't own and control completely . <p> Q : I think we all need to know . Who is best pony ? <p> A : You are going to hate this answer , but I ca n't pick . It 's like asking a Mom to pick her favorite child . <p> Q : Faust , is there anything you would recommend to someone who is about to do their first big animation project ? My capstone for college has to have 8 animators and a minimum 16 crew total , and I 'm kinda running short on what and where exactly I should be looking for everything . Like , is there anything specific I should look for in an animator 's reel , aside from just strong and fluid work ? I 'm the school 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing an animation program , and a lot rides on whether or not I succeed , and any advice you might have would be more than valuable . <p> A : Strong and fluid work--- but also you need to gauge whether they are a good creative fit for your project . Someone can be amazing , but a bad fit . Unless they 're very versatile--- those artists are gems ! ! ! Look for people who can work reliably , and artists who can take the lead when you have too much on your plate . <p> Q : What 's your favorite episode of PPG ? I 've always wanted to know <p> A : Rowdy Ruff Boys ! ! <p> Q : Lauren , since you gave some life advice to someone else - I 've been wanting to break into the animation or art-for-television type of field , but my background is in graphic design . I live in the Midwest and I 'm in my mid-twenties and I feel like I 'm in a rut - not qualified with nothing nearby to push me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do I need to move ? Take classes ? How do you do it ? <p> A : Being in the right place makes a big difference , if you can afford the move . Otherwise , classes , and try to get animation work online , where your location does n't matter . Once you develop good relationships , you 'll get more work and it will be easier to move to where you can get even more work <p> Q : Can you post some sketches of what you 'd like ? That would be really neat to see <p> A : I have some sketches I did several months ago I 've been thinking of posting on DA . I 'll do it next week when I get home ( I 'm traveling ) <p> New Questions <p> Q : I think I remember you telling someone on DA that you originally planned to have the main six have different body types/styles but were either short on time or money . If you had any specific ones already in mind could you describe what each pony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time designing them ? Also , great to see you here again ! <p> A : It 's not that we were short on time and money , it 's that I anticipated it would be a production nightmare to make them all different . I tried to get as much of their individuality into their hair and eye shape as I could . <p> Q : So what 's the deal with the Princesses ? Did you ever plan on going in to more detail with their history ? <p> A : I did n't plan on it , but I was hoping I could <p> Q : Lauren , Seriously , I love you . Stay safe in here , it can get freaky at times , but we all mean well in the end . <p> A : I know . : ) <p> Q : Why did you choose to come here ( 4chan ) ? It 's not like we have the best " fame " in the fandom . I 'm just curious ... <p> A : I 've said it before , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I need to dig through some awful stuff to find it , but people are smart here sometimes . <p> ( Daww , you guys are loved . ) <p> Q : Lauren are you going to any conventions this year ? <p> A : I think I 'll be at Comic Con--- not sure yet <p> Q : Lauren , what was your biggest influence on Rarity ? <p> A : Audrey Hepburn <p> Q : Yo Lauren Faust , " Luna Eclipsed " and the midsection of " Hearth 's Warming Eve " in Season 2 really feel like your work ( and more like Season 1 ) than the other eps in that season . Am I right ? Also , which episodes of Season 2 did you work on the most ( stories , mostly ) ? <p> A : Wow . I ca n't believe you noticed . <p> I worked on all the stories , structurally , and only did script work on the first half . Luna Eclipsed , HWE are two I had a heavier hand in-- also Lesson Zero . Ca n't remember which others . 
@@77556130 @6256130/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> Legends of Equestria is running an open weekend at the moment , as many of you have noticed if you follow EQD 's daily stream of posts at all . I decided to hop on and run around taking screenshots of some of the cooler scenery . When it comes to re-creating out favorite locale 's from the show , this project does not disappoint ! <p> If you have trouble accessing the game , download via the torrent , and keep trying at login . Torrent is faster , and login let 's you in eventually . The site itself is super congested at the moment , so hopefully you all made accounts beforehand ! <p> Anyway , head on down below the break for all of it ! <p> I started off as a unicorn , because my favorite pony of all time is totally a unicorn . Their primary traveling ability ( which is mainly what this Alpha is for at the moment ) is teleport , which you can spam if the server is cooperating . <p> The inventory screen is your typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ponies have a bunch of slots to accessorize on , and at the moment there is a vendor that sells a bunch of this stuff . More on that way below . <p> A good amount of the buildings have been built to look pretty much identical to their show counterparts . Quite a bit of effort went into making these things look like show accurate one-to-one models . <p> They also have a dungeon open in the form of a giant gem cave . This was the second thing I ran into after wandering around at night . The day/night cycles are pretty long from what I have seen so far . Luckily I got a bit of daylight later on in the traveling . <p> Just another shot of the cave . Looks good ! <p> This was the first NPC I ran into . The dialogue is what you 'd expect from a pony run mmo . These guys also work as quest givers handing out various tasks , but the amount of people camping crystals made me move on from that one ! <p> I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few abilities , but Ground Pound seems to do the trick . <p> It looks like they even have a swimming system in place . As someone who has gone through the works when it comes to MMORPGs , it 's always refreshing to not meet an invisible wall when you try diving into the water . I do n't think they can actually go under it yet though . <p> Time for an upgrade ! I saw Pegasus zooming every which way up in the sky , and my measly Teleport could n't do what I needed it to do , so " Totallynot Trixie " grew wings . <p> Cloudsdale itself is awesome . Out of all the cities I ran into , this was by far my favorite one . Everything from the rainbow falls to the various cloud platforms and their respective buildings were just straight up impressive . Rerolling pegasus was more than worth it . <p> Just another shot of general Cloudsdale . Awesome city . <p> They have a pegasus training ground set up for you to practice your flying skills on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into all over the place is massive dance parties . The clip clop of hooves is almost relaxing in a way . <p> My second destination was Canterlot , which links directly to Cloudsdale via the Zeppelin in the image above . <p> This is where my poor laptop really started to suffer . Being able to fly around definitely impacts the performance a bit when gazing into those giant clusters of buildings . I probably should have tossed this game on my actual PC . <p> While the majority of these places are empty at the moment , the alleyways and streets are still an impressive site . Not a whole lot of buildings were copy pasted over . You can tell the team has been putting their hearts and souls into making these places look great . <p> Pretty much everything you 'd expect to find from the show is here , from Donut Joe 's to the giant Canterlot libraries <p> This was probably my favorite one , with the giant spiraling staircases and Alladdin style buildings . <p> One more shot of Canterlot before we move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally starting to come up . <p> Day/Night has a transition period in between with sunsets and sunrises . <p> And now for the day ! Looking back , I probably should have done the entire thing with daylight . My bad ! <p> This is the shop I mentioned earlier on . You can buy various pieces of equipment for your pony to wear . Some were a bit too expensive for my meager 10 gold though , so I went with the potion belt . <p> And that is what it looks like equipped . <p> A couple of the buildings throughout ponyville have been outfitted with interiors , including Twilight 's Library and Rarity 's Botique <p> Inside above . This one was a single room . <p> And that would be the inside of Twilight 's place , which actually includes 2 rooms . <p> The schoolhouse . <p> Yet another massive dance party at Sugarcube Corner . It seems like most people hung out here . <p> My final destination was the dark and gloomy Everfree Forest . As you can see from the image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking . <p> I did take a pretty massive hit on performance due to all the trees . That may have just been my laptop though . It 's outfitted for gaming with a dedicated card , but it 's not anywhere near what a PC would do . Expect this game to require a bit of power to pull off smoothly in the alpha . <p> The monster models are looking great so far . This deer thing was especially impressive . <p> And an obligatory timber wolf . <p> One final shot of the Everfree Forest via a giant fallen log and the river . Their water animation actually looks really good here with this style of graphics . Apparently this place plays host to Zecora 's Hut and Nightmare Moon 's castle too . My laptop could n't take any more of it though . <p> And that about covers it for the sights of Legends of Equestria , or at least what I ran into in my short visit before getting stuck on the screen above ! I 'd highly recommend checking it out if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down below in the comments if you ran into something awesome . The machanics are n't all there yet , but the world is a blast to just fly around in and explore . They did an awesome job at creating/recreating the areas we have seen in the show . You might want to run pegasus for the sake of not having to hoof it everywhere though . The energy bar runs out pretty quick with sprint on . <p> I 'm looking forward to what they come up with in the future . This has a lot of potential to be something great once all the kinks are smoothed out ! Happy travels ! 
@@77556134 @6256134/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> As I mentioned in part 1 of today 's themed art post , Rarity art of the last few years that I gathered from has a pretty big leaning toward the saucy category . This may be due to the fact that the actual show material regularly accents these features lately . She 's well known as a pony that uses her charms to convince others to do things . In the wonderful world of art , things are a bit more liberal . <p> I did n't want to punish these artists , that 's not what art is about . While we will never post explicit art here on the site , " saucy " imagery has always been allowed as long as it does n't go too far . <p> We 've decided to split it into a separate post entirely for anyone that does n't like that . This also let 's us skip hiding 64 images behind a link out of convenience . Do n't expect anything too crazy here . Most of it is barely above the bar she hits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for the sake of regular visitors , even if they are n't visiting this post . Clothing and butts is about as far as this goes . <p> Anyway , if you do like these things or just want some more really well done Rarity from an artistic standpoint and do n't mind what type it is , get it below ! If not , please just skip this post . 
@@77556136 @6256136/ 29897 @qwx649897 <p> San Diego Comic con begins today , and as with every year , expect an absolute deluge of news concerning the event . The Illustrious Q wrote up a guide on the entire convention for those attending or interested in what times news might flood out . Needless to say , it 's a big year for pony ! <p> The new big toy line this year is Guardians of harmony , and Hasbro came out swinging with an SDCC exclusive . Fluttershy and Discord should be available on the floor if you can brave the massive booth lines , or eventually online . We will get updates posted as they appear on their Hasbro Toy Shop site . <p> Anyway , time to dive in ! Expect pictures of just about every angle . I kinda went a little crazy there this time . <p> The ... box ? Yes , I 'm reviewing a box <p> It has been a long time since I last actually reviewed something . When Funko and 4DE stopped releasing regular ponies , my interest waned . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type , so I really only buy things I think look awesome . This is no exception to that rule . <p> For the first time ever , I 'm going to review the box . From the ground up they went all out on this one . The front , as you can see above , has completely custom vectors with the Everfree on one side and a peaceful looking Fluttershy style forest on the other . They definitely have a Good Vs . Evil vibe going here . It 's by far some of the most detailed official pony vector art I 've seen yet . The front is n't where it ends though ! <p> Both sides have more custom art , with Fluttershy being represented by various animals , and Discord touting evil balloons , his hedge maze , and a salt shaker ? That 's some chaos right there ! The box art is basically a celebration of their episodes . <p> On the back we get the mosaic of Discord from his initial appearance , with Fluttershy added on the side , again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides.There is n't an texture here , but it 's colored over with a translucent ink that looks really cool . <p> And to top it off , if you press a button in the middle four LED 's light up the entire thing for a few seconds , similar to the DJ-Pon3 toy they released a few years ago . <p> As someone who really does n't care about resale value and has never been the type to keep boxes laying around , I 'm pretty sure this will be the first I actually hold on to . I opened it up immediately obviously , but the box is n't going to be taking a trip to the recycle bin anytime soon . <p> Discord ! <p> Enough reviewing colorful cardboard , time for DISCORD . We Are Borg did his take on the regular version of this one a few days ago , but this one has a bit more detail . This is my first time holding something from the Guardians lineup , and I walked in not really knowing what to expect . I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was most worried about what kind of quality he would be . Fortunately , he does n't disappoint at all there . A lot of tiny parts go into his overall frame . You can see the connections pretty clearly on each separate piece . There is n't an incredible amount of detail , but they are basing it off a flash show . <p> Every piece is well sculpted without the huge amount of blemishes that you 'd usually find for any mass produced toy ( see any of my old Funko reviews for those ) . There are a few stray paint marks , but overall he 's really well made , much better than what we usually see . <p> The only thing that is a little cheap is the throne with the hollow backing . It 's obvious that the character himself is the focus , and it 's a really minor detail , but it 's worth mentioning . They still managed to give it a cool wood engraving regardless , along with horns . I like the horns . More thrones need horns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . His wings are removable and swappable , and you can take him off his throne by unsnapping a hole in his back , but the arms and pose are stuck on there pretty tight so there really is n't a reason to . He 's definitely more of a display piece than something you 'd give your kids to play with . Think of one of those high end anime figures instead of an action figure . On that front though , he excels . <p> While Discord is the obvious focus here , Fluttershy is actually my favorite part , and probably more representative of what we will see coming up as the Guardians of Harmony lineup trickles out . I 've never been a huge fan of articulated figures in general , preferring more specifically designed display pieces without hinges , but I think butterquiet here has converted me . <p> The ability to pose her into different forms is actually a lot of fun . You can take her from rearing up like above , to the classic pony stance below : <p> She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one for the neck moving up and down , another for side to side , two for the back legs , and three detachable ball sockets for the wings and tail . This gives her a fairly wide range of movement . The front legs in particular provide pretty much any pose you can fit with her mane out of the way . <p> If you want to roleplay an episode where Fluttershy becomes an earth pony , the wings are actually removable . Maybe some day we will get some bat wings for her ? If anyone at Hasbro is reading this , I 'd pay good money for bat wings ! <p> The general quality is really good here too . Fluttershy is much heavier than your traditional pony figure . The entire thing is composed of seemingly solid chunks of interlocking plastic . <p> Unlike Discord I ca n't really think of anything to complain about with her other than how visible the joints are . Having seen many a posable anime figure , I do n't think there is a way to do it without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an improvement over traditional pony brushables . It 's slightly longer and the eyes are more front facing . One thing that bothered me on the usual design is how humongous the foreheads are , and Fluttershy here is does a good job of correcting the majority of that , via a more oblong bird head shape like the show instead of the round egg style the toys have always used . ( More on that below ! ) . <p> Hanging her on things is a lot of fun , especially Discord . I kinda wish she was available during Ponies Around the World so we could see her really chillin in random places . If anything , she is the perfect desk toy . I think I blew at least an hour worth of time today while procrastinating various EQD tasks just posing her . <p> I mentioned earlier that they changed the bridge of the nose and lowered the forehead , something that that has always bugged me in previous toys , and here is a comparison on what I mean . Fluttershy 's overall head design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shortening the distance between the eyes.While not 100% perfect , ( we ca n't all be 2snacks I guess ) it 's a big improvement for me . <p> FINAL VERDICT <p> I 'm honestly really surprised at how much I like these two . I 've never been a massive Discord episode fan , so I did n't go in loving the character . This is actually my first piece of Discord merchandise ever . I really was n't a fan of the Funko one , and the We Love Fine version was way out of my price range . This one is just perfect though . <p> I just got done listening to some of my friends that attended Anime Expo complaining about how expensive everything is over there from licensees that make plastic replicas with pose-able joints , and it honestly feels like a bargain that we , over in ponyland , can get something like this for 50 bucks . Everything from the box to the figures themselves is just quality . <p> I realize that this is one of the big ticket promo items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Guardians of Harmony is even half as good overall , I 'll be happy . Based on We Are Borg 's review of the normal version of this one , it 's looking like this is the standard . <p> Grab her at SDCC for $50 , or follow us for a heads up on when she is available on the Hasbro Toy Shop site !
