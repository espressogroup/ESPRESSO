 * The Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID) is an RDF Schema vocabulary for expressing metadata about RDF datasets. It is intended as a bridge between the publishers and users of RDF data, with applications ranging from data discovery to cataloging and archiving of datasets.

It is a companion to the main specification document for VoID, <em><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/void/">Describing Linked Datasets with the VoID Vocabulary</a></em>.
