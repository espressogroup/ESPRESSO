@@13268812 @1868812/ <h> FAQ <h> What is Earth Engine ? <p> Earth Engine is a platform for petabyte-scale scientific analysis and visualization of geospatial datasets , both for public benefit and for business and government users . <p> Earth Engine stores satellite imagery , organizes it , and makes it available for the first time for global-scale data mining . The public data archive includes historical earth imagery going back more than forty years , and new imagery is collected every day . Earth Engine also provides APIs in JavaScript and Python , as well as other tools , to enable the analysis of large datasets . <h> How is Earth Engine different from Google Earth ? <p> Earth Engine and Google Earth serve different purposes . Google Earth enables you to travel and learn about the world through a virtual globe . You can view satellite imagery , maps , terrain , 3D buildings and much more . Earth Engine , on the other hand , is a tool for analyzing geospatial information . Although Earth Engine has a data catalog , not everything available in Google Earth is available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the data in Earth Engine is not currently available for visualization in Google Earth . <h> Why is Google working on Earth Engine ? <p> Google 's mission is to organize the world 's information and make it universally accessible and useful . In line with this mission , Earth Engine organizes geospatial information and makes it available for analysis . More generally , Google strives to make the world a better place through the use of technology . Earth Engine 's technical infrastructure powers humanitarian , scientific , and environmental initiatives which Google is proud to support . <h> How do I get access ? <p> To get access to the advanced features of Earth Engine , please fill out the form at https : **31;67;TOOLONG . We are not accepting all applications , so please fill out all fields as best you can so we can evaluate your request for access . <p> If you are accepted , you will receive an email titled " Google Groups : You 've been added to **27;100;TOOLONG " within one week of applying . Please read that email , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get access . <h> Is Earth Engine available for commercial use ? <p> Earth Engine 's terms allow for use in development , evaluation , research , and education environments . It may be evaluated in a commercial or operational environment but use is not allowed for sustained production use , and data products generated by Earth Engine may not be sold . However , we do have a commercial license program , so if you are interested in pursuing a commercial application of our product , please contact us at **33;129;TOOLONG . <h> Who uses Earth Engine , what are some examples of how it 's being used ? <p> Earth Engine is used by researchers , nonprofits , educators , and governmental agencies who use the system to analyze large scale geospatial data . Please refer to our Case Studies for examples of how Earth Engine is being used . <h> How does Earth Engine compare to the Landsat and Sentinel data in Google Cloud ? <p> The Earth Engine team has worked in close collaboration with Google Cloud to bring the Landsat and Sentinel-2 collections to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The collections in Google Cloud are best suited to workflows where you need to access the data directly from Cloud services such as Google Compute Engine or Google Cloud Machine Learning . The Earth Engine Code Editor and the Earth Engine API do not access these Cloud collections but instead use the Earth Engine data catalog directly . <h> Can I use my own proprietary imagery and vector data ? <h> Must I display my Earth Engine results on a Google Map ? <p> You are free to display Earth Engine results in any mapping platform . <h> Can I share the results of my analysis ? <p> We encourage Earth Engine users to share the results . Results and analysis scripts may be shared directly with other Earth Engine users through Earth Engine tools , or may be downloaded and shared like any other data . <h> Who owns the algorithms I write in Earth Engine and the results of my analyses ? <p> You do . The results of all analyses you perform are yours . All algorithms that you write with our API are yours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support do you offer ? <p> Once you have been given access to Earth Engine , you may join our Developers list where Earth Engine staff and other Earth Engine users answer questions about each other 's scripts . Approximately once a year , generally in early December , we open up the Earth Engine Research Awards for proposals . We do frequent Earth Engine trainings , which are typically announced on the Developer 's list , as well as through the Google Earth Outreach mailing list . These include the annual Earth Engine User Summit and the Geo for Good conference , typically held at the Googleplex in Mountain View , CA. 
@@13268813 @1868813/ <p> Too many students , though , still are n't acquiring basic skills . Some 130 million children complete four years of school without learning to read or add and subtract . In India , for instance , roughly half of all 5th grade children ca n't read a second grade text or perform a two-digit subtraction problem . In Brazil , only one in ten high-school graduates performs at grade level in math . <p> These gaps in student learning , which are reflected in places all around the world , stem from a host of challenges : students lacking materials at their reading level or in their mother tongue ; teachers who lack the tools they need to succeed ; and kids who ca n't get to school because they 're stuck in a conflict zone , to name just a few . <p> Google has long believed that technology has a vital role to play in tackling these and other educational challenges ; it can get more books to students , more lesson plans to teachers , and classrooms to kids who ca n't get there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in access and opportunity . In prosperous communities , the internet delivers ever-richer learning experiences . But as children in this wired world enjoy online videos , digital tutors and virtual reality , less fortunate students all around the globe are falling ever further behind . <p> At Google.org , our approach to education is to find the most promising nonprofits and put the best of Google " our philanthropy , our people , our products " to work helping them close this worldwide gap in learning and academic opportunity . <h> Philanthropy , the Google way <p> In 2016 Google.org launched a new initiative to give $50 million to organizations that are using technology to solve some of the trickiest parts of this problem in a scalable way . <p> Google has never taken a conventional approach to solving problems , and neither does Google.org . When we support an organization , we commit more than just our funding " we bring these grantees into the company and give them access to our best thinkers . Google engineers volunteer their skills and time to help our grantees take their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tools help them scale solutions . And , always , we share what we learn with the rest of the nonprofit sector ; we believe technology solutions that can help anyone ought to belong to everyone . <p> We 're not looking to help nonprofits go from x to x+1 . We want them to get to x squared . <p> Jacquelline Fuller , Director of Google.org <p> Our education grants will focus on three areas where technology can help : giving more students access to quality learning materials , supporting teacher development , and reaching students in conflict zones . <h> 1 . Giving kids the right materials <p> Around the world , students in low-income communities have to learn with less : fewer books , out-of-date texts , and materials that are culturally irrelevant or even in the wrong language . Technology can bypass the geographic and financial boundaries that can block educational resources from reaching students , while also making those resources more engaging , interactive , and effective . <p> One of our first grantees in this area is the Foundation for Learning Equality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " including books , video tutorials , quizzes " to the 4.3 billion people who lack consistent access to the internet . Their new platform , Kolibri , runs on numerous devices , from repurposed desktop computers to low-cost , off-the-shelf file storage drives , and helps educators access , organize , and customize digital content , even in the most remote locations . So far they 've brought 7,000 videos and 26,000 interactive exercises offline for students in about 160 countries . <p> Our funding , along with Google volunteers providing technical support , will help Learning Equality build a bigger content library and scale their reach to hundreds of thousands of new students . This summer , Google engineers and product experts are volunteering to spend four weeks working side-by-side with Learning Equality 's product team in areas such as UX/UI , content integration , and video compression technology . <h> 2 .

You go into a class and no one sees you . There 's a community of teachers out there , but it 's hard to reach them . <p> Abhinav Mathur , engineer and cofounder of Million Sparks Foundation <p> Technology can make it easier . Google.org is helping local leaders invest in digital tools that offer teachers quality training and confidence-building tools that encourage creativity in the classroom .

It improves power quality and reliability , lowers power prices by allowing more efficient dispatch , and enables much higher penetrations of intermittent solar and wind than would otherwise be possible . Our modeling indicates that grid storage , when combined with breakthroughs in solar and wind could increase renewables deployment by up to 35% by 2050 . <p> In the short term , much cheaper storage , absent innovations in wind and solar that reduce their cost to below coal , could actually drive an increase in coal consumption . Cheaper storage would enable already cheap coal units to run at peak efficiency 24 hours/day , store energy at night and dispatch it during the day -- reducing the demand for load-following natural gas capacity and ultimately resulting in a slight ( 0.3% ) increase in greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions .

Ultimately , we determined that an update using the peak from the 2012-2013 season provided a close approximation of flu activity for recent seasons . We will be applying this update to the US flu level estimates for the 2013-2014 flu season , starting from August 1st .

That 's why we 've worked hard to be carbon neutral as a company , launched our renewable energy cheaper than coal initiative and have invested in several clean energy companies and projects around the world . <p> But what if we knew the value of innovation in clean energy technologies ? How much could new technologies contribute to our economic growth , enhance our energy security or reduce greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions ? Robust data can help us understand these important questions , and the role innovation in clean energy could play in addressing our future economic , security and climate challenges . <p> Through Google.org , our energy team set out to answer some of these questions . Using McKinseys Low Carbon Economics Tool ( LCET ) , we assessed the long-term economic impacts for the U.S. assuming breakthroughs were made in several different clean energy technologies , like wind , geothermal and electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interlinked models that estimates the potential economic and technology implications of various policy and technology assumptions . <p> The analysis is based on a model and includes assumptions and conclusions that Google.org developed , so it is n't a prediction of the future . Weve decided to make the analysis and associated data available everywhere because we believe it could provide a new perspective on the economic value of public and private investment in energy innovation . Here are just some of the most compelling findings : <p> Energy innovation pays off big : We compared " business as usual " ( BAU ) to scenarios with breakthroughs in clean energy technologies . On top of those , we layered a series of possible clean energy policies ( more details in the report ) . We found that by 2030 , when compared to BAU , breakthroughs could help the U.S. : <p> Reduce U.S. total carbon emissions by 13% in 2030 ( 21% with Clean Policy ) <p> Speed matters and delay is costly : Our model found a mere five year delay ( 2010-2015 ) in accelerating technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregate 1.2-1.4 million net unrealized jobs and 8-28 more gigatons of potential GHG emissions by 2050 . <p> Policy and innovation can enhance each other : Combining clean energy policies with technological breakthroughs increased the economic , security and pollution benefits for either innovation or policy alone . Take GHG emissions : the model showed that combining policy and innovation led to 59% GHG reductions by 2050 ( vs. 2005 levels ) , while maintaining economic growth . <p> This analysis assumed that breakthroughs in clean energy happened and that policies were put in place , and then tried to understand the impact . The data here allows us to imagine a world in which the U.S. captures the potential benefits of some clean energy technologies : economic growth , job generation and a reduction in harmful emissions . We have n't developed the roadmap , and getting there will take the right mix of policies , sustained investment in technological innovation by public and private institutions and mobilization of the private sectors entrepreneurial energies . We hope this analysis encourages further discussion and debate on these important issues .

Every time I return from the region , I am energized by the dynamism of the young people I meet but overwhelmed by the challenges the region faces . The combination of high oil and food prices affects the United States economy , to be sure , but the impact on poor people in poor countries is exponentially greater . People have to make hard decisions like taking their children out of school , rationing the little food they have , and in some cases not eating at all . High fuel prices also contribute to lower uses of fertilizer , resulting in lower agricultural yields . The cycle spirals in a way that hurts the poorest people the most . <p> And yet there is another story unfolding simultaneously in Eastern Africa .

Safaricom started trading publicly on the Nairobi stock exchange in June and catalyzed the largest IPO on the continent ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all walks of life , resulting in an over-subscription of stock of more than 400% .

Infrastructure has long been a constraint on economic development and growth in Africa but nobody imagined that a new technology would completely leap-frog the traditional phone and fundamentally disrupt telephony in Africa . I ca n't help but think about rural energy in the same light . Today , countries like Uganda are still 90% unserved by electricity .

What would this look like given large geo-thermal and bio-diesel reserves in East Africa and can renewable energy sources provide opportunities for greener solutions in Africa ? <p> Interacting with dynamic and bright Africans under 30 ( who make up 70% or more of most African countries ) , I can not help but wonder what is on the horizon . People are innovating all over the continent with bio-gas , small scale hydro , wind , and solar power . Where people have electricity , there is a massive difference in economic activity , public services , productivity , and hope about the future . Energy is truly a platform that affects nearly every aspect of rural life . Today , Africa is mostly unserved by power grids but given innovation possibilities , are there not scalable ways to introduce renewable energy to millions of people who are completely unplugged from the global economy today ?

Over the past 10 years , it has sought to construct libraries , curate and create learning materials , and develop training programs that allow experts to share their skills with others " all with a special focus on poor or marginalized communities . The organization sees libraries not just as a place to store books , but as essential tools that can be utilized to combat social inequality , feed creative energies and grow opportunity . <p> In 2010 , a massive earthquake in Haiti set in motion a new focus for Libraries Without Borders : humanitarian emergency programs . Most relief efforts typically focus on providing individuals with basic needs like food , water , and shelter . While these are important , Libraries Without Borders realized that educational tools were also needed in order to combat ignorance , connect isolated groups with the outside world , and build up future resilience .

Aid organizations have been hard at work and cities are starting to show signs of recovery , but the damage is beyond imagination and there are still thousands of people at shelters grappling with daily challenges . As a native of Sendai city , I 'm still speechless seeing the destruction and damage that has been done to the places I love and care about . <p> Weve been looking for ways we can assist in the relief efforts using Googles map-related tools . A few days after the quake , we published updated satellite imagery of northeast Japan in Google Maps and Google Earth , which illustrated the massive scale of devastation in the affected areas . <p> Today , we 've published imagery of the Sendai region at even higher resolution , which we collected on Sunday and Monday . The new Sendai imagery , along with satellite imagery from throughout the area , is now live in the base imagery layer of Google Earth and will soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting updated images and publishing them as soon as they are ready . <p> We hope our effort to deliver up-to-date imagery provides the relief organizations and volunteers working around the clock with the data they need to better understand the current conditions on the ground .

Suggestions include piggybacking on non-telecom infrastructure investments , creating an Internet exchange point , and opening spectrum in WiMax , WiFi and TV white spaces for ISPs . <p> In putting this white paper together , we benefited from the diversity of global challenges that Googlers have experienced when working with networks . The paper also taps into the first-hand knowledge of local stakeholders across public , private , and non-profit sectors . In collaboration with the many complementary players in Liberia , we aim to turn technology opportunity into development progress . <h> 3/16/2011 11:52:00 PM <p> Like the rest of the world , we 've been transfixed by the images and news coming out of the northeastern part of Japan over the past six days .

Ninety-three percent of mobile users in Japan do n't  have top-of-the-line smartphones , so weve recently optimized this Crisis Response page to make it more readable for a wider range of devices . You can also access that version by scanning this QR code : <p> Person FinderWithin the first two hours of the earthquake , we launched Person Finder so people can enter the names of those they 're looking for or have found . You can now also search by entering mobile phone numbers to see if they match any listings . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been optimized for those without smartphones . There are currently more than 250,000 records in the database ( including names shared with us by NHK , the national broadcaster in Japan ) and we 've heard several reports of people who have found their loved ones safe . <p> To help the many people in shelters get word of their whereabouts to loved ones , were also asking people in shelters to take photos of the handwritten lists of names of current residents and email them to us . Those photos are automatically uploaded to a public Picasa Web Album . We use scanning technology to help us manually add these names to Person Finder ; but its a big job that ca n't be done automatically by computers alone , so we welcome volunteers with Japanese language skills who want to help out . <p> Satellite imagesWere also working with our satellite partners GeoEye and DigitalGlobe to provide frequent updates to our imagery of the hardest-hit areas to first responders as well as the general public .

Amidst a series of aftershocks rocking our office , a small group of us in Tokyo and several other Google offices started gathering information about the earthquake to create the Crisis Response information page . <p> As someone who experienced the Kobe earthquake 16 years ago when I was at university , I can not forget the immediate desire for information . There was no way to find out where people 's family and friends were , if transportation would be available to get us home , and most importantly , whether we would be able to find shelter . <p> This experience helped me remember that during a crisis , information about shelters can become increasingly muddled . Together with our Google Crisis Response team , we decided to organize existing public information from local governments about the concerned areas . Because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to access . Collaborating with the Google Maps engineering team in Tokyo , we rapidly put together a page of information on Google Maps for our Crisis Response page . <p> And thanks to our colleagues in California and around the globe , within one hour of the earthquake we launched Google Person Finder , a tool to help locate missing people , in Japanese , Chinese and English . We published sites in Japanese and English with maps , news updates , videos , and resources . We also posted tsunami alerts on the Google homepage for appropriate domains to make sure as many people as possible saw the warning . And in addition to these tools we 've made available , we are donating $250,000 to organizations in Japan who are working on relief and recovery efforts . <p> Our hearts go out to those who have been affected by the tragedy , and we thank the citizens , first responders and organizations working hard to keep everyone safe . <p> Posted by Ken Miura on behalf of Google Japan and international Crisis Response teams <h> Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to locate and learn about places around the world .

In some cases , these citizen mappers take a day to collaboratively focus on a specific area , as more than 60 women did recently in Nairobi , Kenya . Together , they planned a " Ladies Mapping Party , " with the goal of empowering and inspiring a broad array of women to give back to their communities through mapping . From advocates to non-profit leaders , students to computer scientists , environmentalists to editors , these women mapped the places they live and love , know and often visit . <p> The event began with a short training and demo session during which participants received an overview of Google Map Maker , followed by a competition to spur the groups on to map their communities . <p> Training and demo session <p> One of the groups was comprised of three dynamic students from Strathmore University - Betsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had mapped most of the points of interest in their home town , Isiolo , while the broader group of women worked together on Juja , Ongata Rongai and Nyahururu . <p> This strategy of targeted specific regions in Africa seemed to work well for the attendees .

We hope this technology will help stop the destruction of the world 's rapidly-disappearing forests . Emissions from tropical deforestation are comparable to the emissions of all of the European Union , and are greater than those of all cars , trucks , planes , ships and trains worldwide . According to the Stern Review , protecting the world 's standing forests is a highly cost-effective way to cut carbon emissions and mitigate climate change . The United Nations has proposed a framework known as REDD ( Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries ) that would provide financial incentives to rainforest nations to protect their forests , in an effort to make forests worth " more alive than dead . " Implementing a global REDD system will require that each nation have the ability to accurately monitor and report the state of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verifiable . However , many of these tropical nations of the world lack the technological resources to do this , so we 're working with scientists , governments and non-profits to change this . Here 's what we 've done with this prototype to help nations monitor their forests : <p> Start with satellite imagerySatellite imagery data can provide the foundation for measurement and monitoring of the world 's forests . For example , in Google Earth today , you can fly to Rondonia , Brazil and easily observe the advancement of deforestation over time , from 1975 to 2001 : <p> ( Landsat images courtesy USGS ) <p> This type of imagery data past , present and future is available all over the globe . Even so , while today you can view deforestation in Google Earth , until now there has n't been a way to measure it . <p> Then add scienceWith this technology , it 's now possible for scientists to analyze raw satellite imagery data and extract meaningful information about the world 's forests , such as locations and measurements of deforestation or even regeneration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've collaborated with Greg Asner of Carnegie Institution for Science , and Carlos Souza of Imazon . Greg and Carlos are both at the cutting edge of forest science and have developed software that creates forest cover and deforestation maps from satellite imagery . Organizations across Latin America use Greg 's program , Carnegie Landsat Analysis System ( CLASlite ) , and Carlos ' program , Sistema de Alerta de Deforestation ( SAD ) , to analyze forest cover change . However , widespread use of this analysis has been hampered by lack of access to satellite imagery data and computational resources for processing . <p> Handle computation in the cloudWhat if we could offer scientists and tropical nations access to a high-performance satellite imagery-processing engine running online , in the " Google cloud " ? And what if we could gather together all of the earths raw satellite imagery data petabytes of historical , present and future data and make it easily available on this platform ?

Using our cloud-based computing power , we can reduce that time to seconds .

At that time we announced a request for investment proposals ( RFP ) from teams working on technologies relevant to this goal . Today we are pleased to announce our first RechargeIT investments in two promising companies tackling the challenge of vehicle electrification.Aptera Motors of Carlsbad , California is building an ultra-high efficiency vehicle based on improved aerodynamics and composite materials . Aptera 's first prototype achieved over 230 miles per gallon during testing , and they are developing an all-electric as well as a plug-in hybrid vehicle based on this design . <p> ActaCell is an Austin-based company working to commercialize lithium-ion battery technology developed at the University of Texas at Austin . ActaCell 's technology offers the promise of improved battery cycle life and lower costs , while maintaining a focus on battery safety , all of which are important factors in the widespread adoption of plug-in vehicles . <p> Both of these innovative companies and their capable teams are working to develop technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : millions of plug-in vehicles on the road . <h> Tuesday 7/22/2008 12:24:00 PM <p> Last summer Google.org launched the RechargeIT program , an initiative to accelerate the commercialization of plug-in vehicles . As part of this project , we created the GFleet , a free car-sharing program for Google employees . The GFleet includes a handful of hybrid vehicles converted to plug-ins with a Hymotion conversion module . <p> Our plug-in hybrid electric vehicles ( PHEVs ) have been on the road for about a year now , and the RechargeIT team has been diligently collecting statistics on their performance . We noticed that employees primarily use our plug-ins for short trips close to our headquarters , so the data were n't truly representative of typical U.S. driving patterns . We were curious to see how the cars would perform under controlled conditions - and how they would stack up against other conventional automobiles typically found in U.S. households . With that , the RechargeIT Driving Experiment was born ! <p> In total , it took just over seven weeks to complete all the trips in all the vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , with the Priuses getting more than 90 miles per gallon . The PHEVs not only greatly outperformed the average American fleet fuel economy of 19.8 MPG , they did significantly better than the standard hybrids 53% fuel economy improvement for the plug-in Ford Escape and 93% improvement for the plug-in Prius . <h> Thursday 7/10/2008 04:26:00 PM <p> HakiElimu , one of Google.orgs partners , recently released an important report about the quality of education in Tanzania to stimulate a national discussion about the challenges facing the education sector . Media coverage in Dar es Salaam indicates the report has already made an impression and is prompting the government to act . <p> For too long , success in the education sector has been defined by the number of schools and classrooms built and by the increase in student enrollment - measures that do n't necessarily register learning . But the conversation is now shifting : " quality " has become more front and center , forcing governments and development agencies to re-evaluate their policies . <p> Its hard to address the " quality " issue without knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HakiElimus report captures a " snapshot of the quality of education actually provided in schools by presenting the results of short tests administered to children in primary and secondary schools . " The sample pool is small , but the findings are interesting indicators of what may be happening in much of the country . Here are two of the findings that I found most powerful and alarming : <p> One of the tests was a short dictation in both Kiswahili , the national language , and English ( a total of 483 primary school students and 559 secondary school students were tested ) . While students scored higher on the Kiswahili dictations , HakiElimu found it " concerning that 25% of primary pupils Kiswahili dictations were rated " poor . " Pupils who took this test had completed six years of schooling in Kiswahili and yet one in four were unable to write a coherent paragraph as dictated in the national language . In the dictations , students in both primary and secondary schools made fundamental errors in punctuation , giving researchers the impression that these things are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case for letters . Similarly , many did not appear to have a sense of spacing between words , or between letters in the word and between sentences . Knowledge of punctuation was also limited " ( page 29 ) <p> The next point is equally alarming : Primary school students are taught in Kiswahili while in secondary schools the language of instruction is in English . As the report indicates , this is problematic . <p> " Overall , data show that while childrens Kiswahili language competencies are generally well developed , English language competencies are poorly developed in both primary and secondary school students . Students had difficulty in reading , writing and translating the language . This is particularly troublesome in case of secondary school students . On entering secondary schools , children not only have to relearn all the terms and concepts in a new language but also to take on a more difficult set of subjects . If the majority of the students in secondary schools are unable to read and understand the language in which they are taught , as our data show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhanced . ( page 33 ) <p> My colleagues and I often say " you ca n't fix what you cant see . " This report helps to highlight to communities , organizations and the government that while money might be spent on education , there are still significant gaps in learning outcomes . More information and data about these outcomes help create the metrics , so action can be taken to fix these gaps . We are proud of HakiElimu 's work and their commitment to ensuring that citizens and government know more about the quality of education in Tanzania . We believe that the information and the discussions it is sparking in Tanzania are important first steps toward improving the educational system . <h> Wednesday 7/09/2008 09:45:00 AM <p> I recently returned from a research trip across four East African countries . Every time I return from the region , I am energized by the dynamism of the young people I meet but overwhelmed by the challenges the region faces . The combination of high oil and food prices affects the United States economy , to be sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exponentially greater . People have to make hard decisions like taking their children out of school , rationing the little food they have , and in some cases not eating at all . High fuel prices also contribute to lower uses of fertilizer , resulting in lower agricultural yields . The cycle spirals in a way that hurts the poorest people the most . <p> And yet there is another story unfolding simultaneously in Eastern Africa . It is the story of Safaricom , the most successful telecom company on the continent . Safaricom started trading publicly on the Nairobi stock exchange in June and catalyzed the largest IPO on the continent ever . More than $800 million was raised from Kenyans from all walks of life , resulting in an over-subscription of stock of more than 400% . Mobile is growing faster in Africa than in any other part of the world . While levels of internet penetration are well below 5% for the continent , nearly 40% have access to mobile phones and Nairobi sends more text messages in a single day than New York ( a statistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago people were talking about land lines and how they would ever penetrate rural Africa . Infrastructure has long been a constraint on economic development and growth in Africa but nobody imagined that a new technology would completely leap-frog the traditional phone and fundamentally disrupt telephony in Africa . I ca n't help but think about rural energy in the same light . Today , countries like Uganda are still 90% unserved by electricity . Can you imagine not having power in 90% of any country and still trying to grow the economy ? Do we expect Africans to wait for grid electricity to incrementally reach people or are there disruptive innovations that can provide off-grid renewable energy to rural Africans in scaleable ways ? What would this look like given large geo-thermal and bio-diesel reserves in East Africa and can renewable energy sources provide opportunities for greener solutions in Africa ? <p> Interacting with dynamic and bright Africans under 30 ( who make up 70% or more of most African countries ) , I can not help but wonder what is on the horizon .

I served as start up Executive Director for Google.org for nearly three years before moving into the role of Chief Philanthropic Evangelist in February . I love Google , the people who make this such a special place and the world-class team at Google.org . Megan Smith , who has taken on the leadership of Google.org , is doing a terrific job and I am watching her and the other leaders of Google.org with admiration and a great sense of satisfaction that " the work " has passed to such competent hands . <p> When Larry , Sergey and Sheryl Sandberg hired me , I promised to work for at least three years .

Jeff Skoll , founding president of eBay , long time friend of many Googlers , and a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me his fears of a world spinning almost out of control , beset with many simultaneous urgent threats : climate change , nuclear proliferation , Middle East conflict , water scarcity , and emerging communicable disease . He described to me his vision of bundling his many activities to focus them on these " Urgent Threats . " Jeff is the founder of the well regarded Skoll Foundation which for ten years has funded dozens of dedicated social entrepreneurs working all over the world . He also has an extremely successful film making company , Participant Media , which has made films to inspire social change such as An Inconvenient Truth , Good Night and Good Luck , North Country , Syriana , Fast Food Nation , Jimmy Carter - Man From Plains , Darfur Now , The Kite Runner , Charlie Wilson 's War and The Visitor . In addition , his financial services firm , Capricorn Investments , has made investments in electric car companies , renewable energy , and other investments that are driven by multiple bottom line returns . <p> Jeff 's idea was to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making and , most importantly , advocacy and find someone to lead that Fund . He wants the same person who leads that Fund to be a Senior Advisor to him in bringing together his media and film making activities , his investment interests , and the work of social entrepreneurs supported by the Skoll Foundation who focus these urgent threats , so that all of these different " tools " are working together effectively to drive the change we need . He asked me to become President of the Skoll Urgent Threats Fund , sit on the board of the Skoll Foundation , and be Senior Advisor to him on his media and financial investments companies . <p> I have accepted this position and effective May 5 , 2009 ( my 65th birthday ) I will leave Google as a full time employee though I 'll continue to work with Megan and the Google.org team as an advisor . <p> Google.org and the Skoll Foundation already work together to support " virus hunter " Nathan Wolfe whose Global Viral Forecasting Initiative collects and analyzes blood samples of humans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Awardees have played an important role in our thinking at Google.org and in the development of other projects and grants . <p> So these two organizations are neither competitors nor strangers , but rather friends and colleagues . I am not " leaving Google " so much as I 'm going down the road to work with a friend and colleague and I hope that in the coming months and years we can expand that relationship even more . <p> Looking back over the past three years , I 'm incredibly proud of the work done by the team at Google.org to support wonderful projects and people . Some examples : The team at Pratham in India that we support is changing the way we think about development by causing improvements in children 's education in India . Irene Taylor Brodsky 's Oscar nominated film , The Final Inch , is also helping to galvanize global support for the final push to eradicate polio . Working on this film helped my thinking about the media--Rotary International clubs have donated nearly $1 billion to global polio eradication , but you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch The Final Inch and see how much their donated time and money really matters to conquer this disease . They feel their work recognized and celebrated , and they are energized to go raise more money and do more volunteering to conquer this dreaded disease . And the group which emerged from the TED Prize , InSTEDD , is going from " strength to strength " and developing new technologies to enable quick communication and effective response after disasters . At one time they were funded only by Google.org but their work has now been recognized by CDC and by the United Nations emergency relief groups as best in the world and they are being supported by a wide group of organizations . <p> We 've also partnered with Rockefeller Foundation in supporting the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance Network program which is providing early warning about possible pandemic flu outbreaks to the six countries which border the Mekong River . We 've given millions of dollars and direct support using Google Earth , other Google projects and people to support the heroic efforts to respond to Katrina , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sichuan , China . But it might be in the area of clean energy that Google.org has made its largest contribution to the national debate . It was our joint Google.org+Google.com climate team that created " RE&lt;C " our geeky way of saying that until we have renewable energy -- wind , solar , advanced geothermal ( EGS ) -- cheaper than coal , fossil fuels will continue to be burned and continue to release the CO2 which is suffocating the planet . We 've invested in wind , solar and geothermal companies , we 've supported leaders like NRDC , and we advocated in DC for climate change policy and for more resources to drive clean energy R&amp;D . And it has made a big difference in how our government has now responded . <p> Larry and Sergey wrote in their initial Letter from the Founders that they wanted to make approximately 1% of Google 's equity and profits and substantial employee time devoted to philanthropy . I hope other corporations will follow the example to devote significant resources to the greater good and I support Google.org 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology to address the global challenges of our age . " <p> I lack the words to adequately thank Larry and Sergey for hiring me , for giving me a chance to lead this wonderful " experiment in active philanthropy " that Google.org has become , and I want to thank Megan Smith and her advisory team of Urs Hoelzle , David Fischer , and Salar Kamangar for their leadership going forward . I especially want to thank the Googlers , both in " dotorg " and " dotcom " that make Google such a special place . I wish time and space allowed me to name each and every one who has taught me , touched me , helped and supported me . I do believe the press which says that this is the best company to work for anywhere . Googlers are the kindest and most wonderful colleagues and friends anyone could ask for . Thank you for your friendship and support---and remember I am not going far away so I do hope Google.org and the Skoll philanthropies will find many areas for working together in the months and years ahead .

So it was n't surprising that when we considered areas to support with our philanthropic efforts , helping entrepreneurs in developing countries rose to the top . This past January we launched an initiative to Fuel the Growth of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises ( SMEs ) . SMEs in developed countries account for half of GDP and two-thirds of jobs , but they 're largely absent in developing countries . We wanted to explore how we could help drive capital to these high-growth businesses . At the same time , we launched a parallel effort to increase access to vital information in poor countries . This effort , known as Inform and Empower , aims to help improve the quality of public services by organizing critical information and making it accessible to all ( sound familiar ? ) . <p> We still strongly believe that growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google 's ten organizing principles is , " it 's best to do one thing really , really well . " As we evaluated our efforts this past year , it became clear that given Google.org 's unique strengths - including the ability to tap Google engineers to build and link better pathways to information - we could have a greater impact on the lives of the poor by focusing our efforts on Inform and Empower . As a result , we 're putting our SME initiative on the back burner . We 'll continue to support the grants and investments that we 've already committed under the initiative . We have observed and learned from many others addressing the challenges of financing SMEs -- many of whom are seeing significant strong results -- and we hope they continue with great success . At this time , however , we will not fund new efforts in the SME space . <p> Google remains committed to its philanthropic goal : using information and technology to take on some of the world 's greatest challenges . We continue to draw upon resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as outlined by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in their 2004 letter to investors . We 've had a strong year of giving since the launch of our initiatives . We know that the global financial crisis is disproportionately affecting the poor and plan to increase our overall giving in 2009 . <h> Friday 12/19/2008 11:53:00 AM <p> In early 2008 , Google.org announced its initiatives to the world and made clear how the company would leverage its people , money , and creativity to address some of the worlds most pressing and difficult problems . Among them were climate change/renewable energy , global poverty , and emerging threats . <p> In Africa , one of our initiatives is focused on leveraging the power of information ( or the right to know ) to increase transparency , accountability , and ultimately the delivery and quality of public services . " You ca n't change what you cant see " is one of our mantras , and our job is to shine light in dark places and help people decipher the black box of public service delivery . What is working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to plug holes in a leaky pipeline of service delivery ? <p> Much of the initiative is about unlocking quasi-public information . One of my colleagues calls it DBHD ( database hugging disorder ) . Why is so much " public " information not accessible ( ie government budgets , service level indicators , population data ) and sitting on servers in London , New York , and Geneva but not accessible to citizens , media , and even planners in Africa countries ? This clearly needs to change . <p> What is less intuitive , however , is that there is so much information , knowledge , and wisdom within Africa that is not making its way to politicians , planners , and policy makers who make decisions about Africa . We often hear that teachers , nurses , and civil servants do not show-up for work across the continent and this is a primary contributor to the poor quality of public services . Do we bother asking why absenteeism is such a problem ? Ask teachers , nurses , or administrators and they will tell you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was adopted in many African countries more than a decade ago , classroom sizes have doubled if not tripled while teacher salaries , instructional materials , and training have hardly changed at all . Government dispensaries are rarely stocked with medications that people come to purchase so why bother staffing clinics ? <p> Last month in rural Uganda , I saw an example of how information gathered from students is helping a local NGO address pupil absenteeism in a very targeted way . The primary school has created a student-led club that investigates why students are missing school and why they drop-out . After all , fellow students face similar challenges and know much about their peers . It turns out that most students dropping out are girls ; early pregnancy and lack of finances to purchase school uniforms are leading causes of student absenteeism . <p> With this information in hand , the Kabarole Research Centre is working with student leaders to plant a community garden to raise money to buy uniforms for needy students , and both are working with community leaders and parents committees to raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several young girls have returned to school after giving birth , and school administrators are more aware of what needs to happen to reduce student attrition . <p> And so its not just about delivering information to people so they can make better decisions . Its also about listening to people to make sure donors , planners , and government officials make better decisions . Using student leaders to understand better why their peers are missing school may seem obvious , but such approaches are pretty rare in top-down systems . Better information is certainly not a panacea but its a necessary condition to make better decisions based on evidence rather than anecdote . <h> Thursday 12/18/2008 10:40:00 AM <p> There 's a great deal of talk about the high cost of oil and the billions of dollars that the US and other oil-importing nations spend each year to buy oil .

( You can see these selections by clicking on the buttons below the map on the RMI website . ) One interesting time period is from 1982 to 1985 , when low prices caused oil imports from the Middle East to decline to very low levels . <p> The map also looks at potential oil from offshore drilling and exploration of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) . The screenshot below illustrates the impact of off-shore drilling . With the map zoomed or drilled 3-5 levels down and centered near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , check out the very thin line that shows the potential peak production of 220,000 barrels per day.The lines represent estimates of production in 20-30 years , and even with this very long timeline , the amount of oil that could be generated from offshore drilling is miniscule compared to our oil needs today . <p> Both Google and RMI are working hard to help create a future where we are not reliant on daily imports of millions of barrels of oil that pollute our atmosphere and risk our national security . <p> Today , along with the Brookings Institution , RMI is hosting " The Oil Solutions Initiative " a summit to identify solutions to break Americas dependence on oil , with Google in attendance .

The absence of adequate sewage collection and treatment imparts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghanas urban areas where the risk of epidemics is highest given the large number of people in a confined area . <p> One of the pathways with highest risk of disease transmission is the widespread consumption of raw vegetables irrigated with surface water which is heavily polluted with excreta related pathogens . Over 200,000 people eat such dishes every day in the Accra fast food sector . While most local consumers might have a higher resistance to the diarrhea causing-rotavirus than Ghanas average tourists , there is no resistance when it comes to cholera , as the current outbreak in Zimbabwe shows . <p> Most sanitation models are imported from the developed world and seldom fit the conditions and capacities in low-income countries which explains the catastrophic statistics given above - and jeopardizes their purpose of safeguarding public health . Until this situation changes , it may make sense to challenge the traditional approach and outsource some sanitation-related public services from the financially constrained public sector to those who benefit from the waste stream , like farmers and vegetable sellers .

He delivered a powerful talk that highlighted the risk of a devastating future pandemic , and described one of his big ideas for combating the threat . His mantra of ' Early Detection , Early Response ' inspired other groups such as InSTEDD , who recently launched a suite of open-source applications to allow collaboration between first responders during disease outbreaks and disasters , and the team behind Google Flu Trends . <p> Now , this important theme has been revisited at TED by Dr. Nathan Wolfe , founder of the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative ( GVFI ) , a new non-profit funded by Google.org and the Skoll Foundation . Dr Wolfe 's rousing message is that when it comes to pandemics , early detection in humans is n't early enough . We know that 75% of new human diseases begin in animals so to discover a pandemic before it devastates the human population , we need to catch new viruses when they take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This mission has taken the GVFI team into some remote and difficult locations , from the jungles of Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo ( profiled on CNN 's Planet in Peril ) , to the wet markets of China and Malaysia .

Pass this on , and help spread ideas , not diseases ! <h> Monday 3/16/2009 05:51:00 PM <p> An interesting article making a case for the use of online information for earlier detection of disease outbreaks came out last week in the Canadian Medical Association Journal . The article , co-authored by HealthMap co-founder and Google.org grantee John Brownstein , looks at an outbreak of listeriosis in Canada and compares online search trends , news reports , and diagnosed case counts during the outbreak period . <p> Listeriosis is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Canada killed about 20 people last summer . By using Google Insights for Search data combined with HealthMap 's news surveillance data , the authors discovered that a specific search query provided even earlier indication of the outbreak than news reports . <p> So , what was that key search term that gave the earliest indication of the outbreak ? Listeriosis . That 's right , when the researchers looked at trends for people searching online for the technical term " Listeriosis , " they discovered that the peak of the search trend for that term was the same as the actual peak of medically diagnosed Listeriosis cases . The increase in online searches for " Listeriosis " began in mid-July , one month before the federal announcement that an outbreak was underway in Canada . This means that people diagnosed with Listeriosis , or others close to them , were likely to be the ones searching for that term online at the time of diagnosis , causing a spike . <p> In contrast , search trends for " Listeria , " the term used in the public announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement and other news reports in mid-August . Thus , people searching for " Listeria " were probably doing so in response to the press about the outbreak , not because they 'd been diagnosed . <p> Early detection is critical to helping health officials respond more quickly . While documenting the potential for using online info for earlier outbreak detection , the authors also recognize the challenges . This seems to be the tip of the iceberg for research in this area , and it has others talking too - check out the Wall Street Journal blog which calls this " a wonkier example of Google Flu Trends .

In the days that followed , a record number of volunteers flooded disaster response agencies , government agencies , churches and local outreach organizations with calls to find out how they could help . I was one of those volunteers and what I experienced changed my life forever . <p> Three years later , much of the region remains abandoned . Repair of city infrastructure and tourism ( the primary economic source for this part of the nation ) are slow and stagnant in much of the region . We will be successful in turning around these trends only if we come together and rededicate ourselves to this effort . As part of the Black Googlers Network ( BGN ) , 32 colleagues and I traveled to the region for what was initially slated as a Katrina Rebuilding Outreach Trip . As New Orleans slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by side with the proud and resilient residents of this amazing city to help them repair the lives they 've worked so hard to rebuild , sending a clear message that they are not forgotten . <p> As our group planned to deploy so quickly after Hurricane Gustav , most agencies were still shut down because their employees were evacuated to other parts of the country . Notable exceptions to this shut down were two organizations to which I have personal ties - St. Bernard Project and The Idea Village . <p> St. Bernard Project is a nonprofit , community-based organization that began rebuilding homes in August 2006 ( boasting 177 projects to date ) that were damaged by flood waters from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in St. Bernard Parish , Louisiana . St. Bernard Parish is a working class community and was one of the hardest hit parishes of the city because of its location just 5 miles from the now infamous Industrial Levee . <p> The Idea Village is an organization working to accelerate the growth of the entrepreneurial community in the embattled New Orleans region . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch plan for their 504ward $200,000 business plan competition by employing our business savvy , creative thought processes and Google product knowledge .

The Idea Village 's motto is " Trust Your Crazy Ideas , " but I do n't see anything crazy about wanting to rebuild one of America 's greatest cities . <p> The highlight of the trip was that at each build site , the families whose homes we were returning to their former grace stopped by to say hello , offer their gratitude and recount the stories of survival . Andrea was the owner of the home I was rebuilding . She was the mother of two small children and was anxious to return a sense of normalcy to all of their lives .

Even with all of the progress made to get people back into their homes , communities are fractured and without basic services and business opportunities . <p> On the final day of our trip , we went to the Upper and Lower Ninth Ward , the areas most devastated by the hurricanes . The neighborhoods were absent of life ; there is little or nothing for residents to come back to . But signs of hope included children riding bikes , families and neighbors barbecuing on the front lawns of their homes ( many still tattooed with the post storm FEMA markings ) and a few bold projects such as the The Musicians ' Village and Brad Pitt 's Make it Right project .

Energy has taken center stage in D.C. during this short session before the October recess , and more than two dozen senators participated in the summit 's morning session alone . <p> Dan and other member of the panel stressed the importance of improving energy efficiency as the low-hanging fruit in the energy policy debate .

Fortunately , this debate has now been mostly put to rest with the release of the fourth assessment of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) last year , which stated : " Warming of the climate system is unequivocal.

This time the debate is not focused on attributing a cause to global warming but rather what to do about adapting to it impacts . Is improving management to current climate variability an adaptation strategy ? Or is climate adaptation more about developing strategies to manage the severe climate change impacts projected for 20-50 years in the future ? <p> Questions such as these arose in a recent workshop that Google.org sponsored in Kenya on climate and health . " Are we talking about climate variability or climate change ? " participants would ask during working groups focused on identifying strategies for reducing vulnerability to the emergence and spread of climate-sensitive diseases . <p> The crux of the variability vs. change discussion began when Phil Thornton from ILRI presented an overview of the state of the science on climate projections which highlighted the huge uncertainty in projections from the Global Climate Models ( GCMs ) out toward the middle and end of century . Then Caroline Kisia , executive director of Action Africa Help International ( AAHI ) and a medical doctor who works with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate science stuff is interestingbut it is not clear what communities are supposed to do with this information there is too much uncertainty to define any real actions here . <p> A few case studies were then presented showing how weather and seasonal climate projections have the potential for improving management for climate-sensitive diseases such as rift valley fever , malaria , meningitis and dengue . These seemed to be helpful , but how are they related to climate adaptation ? <p> These are all good points and good questions . It seems that Caroline was asking the climate scientists and health experts in the room to put aside their fancy models and labels and just focus on the community needs . <p> Communities today across the globe , and especially in Africa , have many needs related to managing the risks of climate and weather including floods , droughts , and climate-sensitive diseases . The workshop discussions highlighted the opportunities and challenges of connecting the climate and health sectors to build tools for managing these risks . <p> Ultimately , for the poorest regions of the world facing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part simply about a heightened need for communities and nations to do what they need to do anyway in pursuit of sustainable development such as improve health services , develop drought-resistant crop options and diversify income sources . <p> Does this all then just come down to semantics ? At the community level it may be best not to worry about labels such as variability , change or adaptation . However , the implications of these semantics may be far reaching as policymakers to develop much needed climate adaptation assistance programs and face important questions such as who should pay for climate adaptation in the poorest nations where communities are most vulnerable to but least responsible for the changes underway ? And what should be paid for , that is , what constitutes climate adaptation ? <p> These are tough questions . I am optimistic that if we do n't get stuck on the semantics but keep our eyes on our goals we will find solutions to enable the most vulnerable populations to take the concrete actions needed to improve their health and livelihoods . <p> Rosemary Sang led a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons learned from the major RVF outbreak in 2006-07 where 155 people died . <h> 9/19/2008 11:36:00 AM <p> A guest post from our friends and partners at the Acumen Fund : <p> If you care about market-based approaches to poverty alleviation , then the Acumen Fund Fellowship might be a dream job .

In developed countries , SMEs represent half of GDP and two-thirds of jobs , but they 're largely absent in developing countries . Access to finance is a critical constraint , despite evidence that there are highly profitable untapped growth opportunities . It requires taking some risk . We saw this firsthand when we met Joseph Tackie in Ghana , an entrepreneur whose sales quintupled after getting a relatively small amount of seed capital . <p> The mission of EFL is to develop a screening test that could be a criterion for loans to SMEs . Because these businesses often lack formal accounting ledgers or established credit histories , it 's very difficult for investors and lenders to gauge risk or finance-worthiness of businesses . When evaluating developing country SMEs , financial institutions have little information to be able to make investment decisions or measure the trustworthiness of clients . Does she have a good track record at repayments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Does she understand the market and how to run a business ? Evidence suggests information such as credit scores helped banks penetrate the SME market here in the US . <p> We hope the EFL test will address the information asymmetry and help entrepreneurs get their foot in the door at banks and investment firms . The test , a psychometric screening tool , will assess " soft traits " of psychological , social , and cognitive characteristics to measure a person 's entrepreneurial potential . Financiers can then use the information to make lending decisions . The test could be an initial step toward the goal of expanding profitable lending to the missing middle . <p> EFL is already working with SME financiers in Africa , India and Latin America to refine their tool through field testing and pilots .

Eric Schmidt and GE CEO Jeff Immelt discuss solutions to our energy challenge in this video : <p> As a South African medical doctor with training and experience firmly fixed on human health , I am continuously struck by the enormous challenge of communicating usefully across academic disciplinary boundaries in a way that allows the science to inform relevant , practical action . While the information on climate variability and change was fascinating , I still struggled to understand how and why this could have direct implications for the day-to-day work of someone like me . <p> Fortunately , the convening included several case studies designed to illustrate the real benefits of collaboration . First , we looked closely at the Kenyan outbreak of Rift Valley Fever ( RVF ) in 2006/7 . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both humans and livestock , and carries an enormous economic cost . In late October and mid-November of 2006 , two early warnings were issued based on evidence of above-normal rainfall that could be detected using remote sensing imagery . Unfortunately it was not until weeks later when the first human cases were observed that the outbreak was recognized , despite the fact that several livestock deaths had already occurred . Although the climate-based warnings and animal deaths were both early indicators of potential human disease , these opportunities for intervention were missed due to communication gaps between the different scientific communities . It 's often said that diseases do n't respect national boundaries , but RVF is the perfect example of a disease that does n't respect academic boundaries either . As the Kenyan example shows , successful control of disease in humans requires collaboration with those working on environmental , animal health and insect science issues ( at a minimum ! ) .

Her parents knelt down and made a deal with God in 1948 : If He would spare their only remaining child , they would dedicate their lives to caring for her . And care for her they did for 50 more years , until their own deaths . Today , Martha still lives in the house where she first got sick , a simple farmhouse just down the street from the Baptist Church in her town of 300 people . Back in the 60s , Martha spent four years at Wake Forest University ( where she graduated Valedictorian ) , otherwise , she 's pretty content to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest Wal-Mart or gas station , is 13 miles away . <p> Hillary Clinton 's saying is , " it takes a village , " and in Martha 's case , Lattimore has helped keep her going all these years .

Martha gets a visitor just about every day , and a local friend set her up with a voice-recognition computer which she uses " to travel the world . " ( She also reads four newspapers a day . ) The Baptist Church tapes its service every Sunday for her . The doctors make house calls . Even though polio seems all but disappeared in this country , in this tiny American town , they have n't forgotten it . How can they ? They have Martha . <h> Monday 7/02/2007 03:15:00 PM <p> Posted by Alix Zwane , Researcher , google.org <p> I first got to know google.org while on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a joint Harvard/UC Berkeley study on cost-effective water investments in developing countries . The Millennium Development Goals call for reducing by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water . This goal was adopted in large part because clean water was seen as critical to fighting diarrheal disease , which kills 2 million children annually . Together with my teammates Edward Miguel , Jessica Leino , and Michael Kremer , I 've been undertaking field-based research to assess the effectiveness of water quality improvements in western Kenya . There is compelling evidence that provision of piped water and sanitation can substantially reduce child mortality . However , it 's expensive , which has led many poor countries to instead provide community-level water infrastructure , such as wells . But somewhat surprisingly , we actually know very little about how well these kind of investments do at reducing the diarrheal disease burden . Our research is intended to provide rigorous evidence on this question . <p> Our approach measures the impact of spring protection , a process that clears and seals off the source of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeping from the ground . Naturally-occurring springs are an important source of drinking water in western Kenya , but they 're vulnerable to contamination when left unprotected , particularly from human and animal fecal matter . A locally-based non-governmental development organization ( NGO ) is protecting 200 springs in Busia , Kenya over a four-year span , and they 've kindly let us tag along . <p> Taking E. coli as our fecal indicator bacteria , our preliminary analysis suggests that spring protection leads to large improvements in source water quality . Not all of these improvements translate to improved water quality at home perhaps 70% but recontamination during transport and storage may be less of a concern than is sometimes claimed . We 're still trying to figure out whether these water quality gains have led to child health improvements ; either way , our findings will help us understand the benefits of achieving the water Millennium Development Goal . <p> I should also mention that I 'm now a full-time Googler funny how life happens ! so stay tuned here for future research updates .

As a woman , I have n't been allowed into mosques , but I 've stayed determined to somehow get my crew inside of one to record the beautiful , haunting , beckoning sounds heard five times a day throughout Muslim neighborhoods all over India . These calls mingle with bad static , reverb , or a low hum over low-quality outdoor loudspeakers . A crude transmission , perhaps , but an unforgettable sound . <p> That day in Meerut , my camera man and sound man were in the neighborhood mosque while I waited outside , intently listening to what our camera was recording inside . A crowd started to gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because of our jeep and the two women left alone in it . We were a curiosity . A diminutive man with a wide smile ambled up to our car , " May I kindly know , Madam , what you are doing here in our neighborhood today ? " He was paraplegic , with a steel walker around the front of his five-foot-tall body like a miniature Colosseum . His walker was very worn out , and was at least three or four inches too short for him in a way that made his back lean over and his smile look up . I explained our film . He keenly listened to every word and replied simply , " My name is Muhammad Gulzar , and I am a polio survivor . Madam , may I help you ? " <p> I 'm not a superstitious person , but I could n't help but feel as I drove away that day with his phone number in my pocket that all of my earlier failed attempts to film a call to prayer ( the first time we did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masked the sounds ... ) had but one purpose : To lead me to this mosque , on this corner , to this polio survivor named Gulzar . <p> An educated and unemployed Muslim , Gulzar volunteered with our crew over the next two days and eventually opened his doors to us to film him . After two weeks of filming the effort to eradicate the disease in India , it was there in Gulzar 's home that we finally saw polio up close and personal . He was 24 years old , but in the privacy of his home he had to crawl like a baby . In public , he wore calipers on his legs , and his hands bore the calluses of someone who carries his own weight every day on a frame of steel . His family ( one of the most loving and supportive I 've known ) clearly makes every accommodation for Gulzar , but the realities of public life can be cruel . There are no handicap ramps into buildings , no adjustable lifts onto buses no way , I realize , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of India 's best and brightest , but how , I wonder , can Gulzar possibly get to a job ? Mobility is his greatest challenge . <h> 7/02/2007 09:49:00 AM <p> Posted by Greg Miller , Managing Director , google.org <p> Last fall our team spent time talking with philanthropies and other organizations with long histories of successful interventions in the field of global public health . Considering many ideas , we talked about what it will take to finally eradicate polio in the developing world , and the role that philanthropy can play . Many of our parents remember what it was like to have polio in this country , and a few people in the States still reside in iron lungs . These generations are advancing , and it 's important that we not forget how horrible the crippling of polio can be to those who are at risk today . <p> The community of nations , health workers and funders have come very close to wiping polio off the map : in 1988 over 350,000 cases of polio were reported ; last year that number had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under age 3 in just a few countries India , Nigeria , Afghanistan and Pakistan .

" In 2004 , he organized the Copenhagen Consensus to have teams of economists recommend solutions to the worlds greatest problems . Experts were asked to assess what solutions provided the biggest bang for our buck in areas that spanned politics , economics , and the environment . Google.org adviser Lant Pritchett authored one of the ten " challenge papers " on education , and I did one on water and sanitation . The results were controversial not so much because of what was ranked at the top - HIV/AIDS - but because of what was at the bottom - climate change . <p> On Sunday May 25 , the Danish Prime Minister opened Copenhagen Consensus 2008 , the sequel . Lant Pritchett and I are back too . Lant authored one of two official critiques of the new Education challenge paper . Alix Zwane and I critiqued the 08 Water and Sanitation Challenge Paper by Dale Whittington and colleagues . In our contribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Harvard and UC Berkeley produced . This work , based on results from field work in Kenya , was funded by one of the first Google.org grants and shows that novel water treatment products ( one of which is marketed under the name WaterGuard ) for home use can be cost-effective ways to reduce diarrhea , a major cause of child mortality . In contrast to the research that Alix and I refer to , Whittington 's challenge paper is more pessimistic about whether water and sanitation interventions are the best use of scarce resources that are supposed to improve the lives of the poor . They base this claim mostly on the expense of the technologies they consider ( wells , piped water and sewerage ) . <p> In our review , Alix and I argue that a key reason that water services are not working for the poor is the same reason why other public services are failing the poor : a lack of accountability between providers , policymakers , and consumers that has resulted in bad management and governance . The best technologies in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premise of Google.orgs Inform and Empower Initiative . We believe that accountability is linked to information quality and information flows .

It 's been a great car and , after more than 100,000 miles , it has a lot of memories : a ski trip to Lake Tahoe through a blizzard , driving down the I5 to Los Angeles , driving across the entire country and then back ! However , over the last few years I started to feel guilty about the how much gas my car managed to guzzle . The official stats claimed 19 miles-per-gallon on the highway , but they must have been driving slower than I do because I never saw that sort of mileage . So , I was excited when the government approved the " Cash for Clunkers " program ! <p> I talked it over with my wife , and we decided it was time to upgrade to a more environmentally friendly car . We looked around , and decided to get a Toyota Prius . After checking out the Cash for Clunkers website , I figured out that because the Prius is rated at 50 mpg , well more than 10 mpg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were eligible for a $4,500 trade-in value through the program . That made the Prius not only a environmentally friendly choice , but an economically attractive one as well . We found a participating dealer nearby and headed over to trade in our clunker . <p> After a quick test drive and some effective negotiations , we struck a deal and bought the new car . As always , there was quite a bit of paperwork involved , including a few extra pages for the " Cash for Clunkers " program . ( Then again , $4,500 is certainly worth a couple of pages of paperwork . ) After signing on the dotted line , the car was ours . <p> Just today President Barack Obama signed a bill extending funding for this incredibly popular program , which burned through its $1 billion budget in just one week . It 's not often you can get something you want , feel like you 're doing something good for the planet , and get $4,500 for doing it .

McKinsey predicts that an annual investment of roughly $50 billion over the next 10 years would cut energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth $1.2 trillion ! The energy savings would be equal to taking the entire U.S. passenger fleet of cars and trucks off the road . <p> Such efficiency gains are possible only if we overcome some major hurdles . For instance , most people have no idea how much energy we use in our homes on a daily basis or which of our appliances or devices are consuming the most energy . That 's one of the reasons that we created Google PowerMeter , a software gadget that shows users detailed information on their home electricity consumption . Studies show that when people have access to this kind information they reduce their energy use by up to 15% . Greater savings are possible if people use the information to buy a more efficient refrigerator or air conditioner , insulate their home , or take advantage of off-peak electricity rates . <p> The McKinsey report acknowledges that energy efficiency alone wo n't solve our energy and climate challenges . We must continue to put major resources into low-carbon sources of energy like renewable energy , and the federal economic stimulus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a good start .

Whether you 're interested in U.S. elections , today 's hot trends , or each year 's Zeitgeist , patterns in Google search queries can be very informative . Last year , a small team of software engineers began to explore if we could go beyond simple trends and accurately model real-world phenomena using patterns in search queries . After meeting with the public health gurus on Google.org 's Predict and Prevent team , we decided to focus on outbreaks of infectious disease , which are responsible for millions of deaths around the world each year . You 've probably heard of one such disease : influenza , commonly known as " the flu , " which is responsible for up to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year . If you or your kids have ever caught the flu , you know just how awful it can be . <p> Our team found that certain aggregated search queries tend to be very common during flu season each year . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , and we found that there 's a very close relationship between the frequency of these search queries and the number of people who are experiencing flu-like symptoms each week . As a result , if we tally each day 's flu-related search queries , we can estimate how many people have a flu-like illness . Based on this discovery , we have launched Google Flu Trends , where you can find up-to-date influenza-related activity estimates for each of the 50 states in the U.S. <p> The CDC does a great job of surveying real doctors and patients to accurately track the flu , so why bother with estimates from aggregated search queries ? It turns out that traditional flu surveillance systems take 1-2 weeks to collect and release surveillance data , but Google search queries can be automatically counted very quickly . By making our flu estimates available each day , Google Flu Trends may provide an early-warning system for outbreaks of influenza . <p> For epidemiologists , this is an exciting development , because early detection of a disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new strain of influenza virus emerges under certain conditions , a pandemic could emerge and cause millions of deaths ( as happened , for example , in 1918 ) . Our up-to-date influenza estimates may enable public health officials and health professionals to better respond to seasonal epidemics and though we hope never to find out pandemics . <p> We shared our preliminary results with the Epidemiology and Prevention Branch of the Influenza Division at CDC throughout the 2007-2008 flu season , and together we saw that our search-based flu estimates had a consistently strong correlation with real CDC surveillance data . Our system is still very experimental , so anything is possible , but we 're hoping to see similar correlations in the coming year . <p> We could n't have created such good models without aggregating hundreds of billions of individual searches going back to 2003 . Of course , we 're keenly aware of the trust that users place in us and of our responsibility to protect their privacy . Flu Trends can never be used to identify individual users because we rely on anonymized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . The patterns we observe in the data are only meaningful across large populations of Google search users . <p> Flu season is here , so avoid becoming part of our statistics and get a flu shot ! And keep an eye on those graphs if you 're curious to see how the flu season unfolds ... <p> Update on 11/21 : The team just published an academic paper in Nature , the international journal of science , explaining the science and methodology behind Flu Trends . Check it out for more information .

Suddenly , mainstream leaders from government , business , and academia are now singing the same song . Al Gores film awakened an environmental consciousness in the general population , and it seems we have finally passed a tipping point !

Want to learn about the role the private sector can play in international development ? Curious what it would be like to help a company based in a developing country address some of its most pressing strategic needs ? If your answer , like mine , is an emphatic yes , it 's not too late to apply for the Acumen Fund Fellows program , which is accepting applications until October 24 for its next class of fellows . <p> Acumen Fund , a non-profit venture capital fund based in New York City , invests in entrepreneurial approaches to reducing global poverty . In addition to providing capital , Acumen Fund offers management support to its investees through its year-long Fellows program . I joined the second annual class of Fellows in September to begin two months of orientation and training in New York . In the first four weeks of the program , the other Fellows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders , discussed case studies of businesses working in developing countries , participated in leadership development activities , and begun to research the businesses to which we have been assigned . I will soon be heading out to work for an ambulance company in Mumbai , India to assist with its marketing strategy as it strives to meet the emergency medical needs of the city 's poorest . After nine months in the field , I will return to New York for a month to share the lessons I 've learned and wrap up the one-year fellowship program . <p> The program has attracted a diverse group of fellows from around the world who share an interest in meeting the needs of the poorest through sustainable private sector approaches . My own path to the Fellows program is as different as the rest of those in the program . After receiving my Masters degree in public policy with a focus on international development , I worked on a range of international economic issues as well as on development and foreign aid policy at the State Department , the US Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having worked on poverty from a high-level policy perspective , I was interested in getting back into the field and learning about the constraints that the private sector faces in developing countries .

They have worked on microfinance in Kenya , design thinking to solve business problems , refugee resettlement , low-income housing development in Pakistan , and management and organizational consulting . Each of us brings a unique perspective to our discussions of business , international development , and leadership , creating a rich learning environment for all of us . <p> If you 're interested in applying for this unique program , you can find additional information here . <h> Monday 10/15/2007 08:38:00 AM <p> Last week the Nobel Foundation awarded Al Gore and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) the Nobel Peace Prize . Former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on climate change and his Oscar winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth . The IPCC , a joint project of the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization , was honored for its efforts over the past two decades to educate the world about climate change . Earlier this year , the IPCC issued its strongest statement to date , finding the evidence of climate change " unequivocal " and concluding with 90% certainty that humans are the cause . <p> In awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to leaders in the battle against climate change , the Norwegian Nobel Committee emphasizes that the problem 's effects go beyond climate , and extend to individual security and opportunity . In the award press release they state : <p> " Indications of changes in the earth 's future climate must be treated with the utmost seriousness , and with the precautionary principle uppermost in our minds . Extensive climate changes may alter and threaten the living conditions of much of mankind . They may induce large-scale migration and lead to greater competition for the earth 's resources . Such changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerable countries . There may be increased danger of violent conflicts and wars , within and between states ... the Norwegian Nobel Committee is seeking to contribute to a sharper focus on the processes and decisions that appear to be necessary to protect the worlds future climate , and thereby to reduce the threat to the security of mankind . Action is necessary now , before climate change moves beyond mans control . " <p> Al Gore has argued for rising to meet the challenge of climate change from a moral perspective : " The climate crisis offers us the chance to experience what few generations in history have had the privilege of experiencing : a generational mission ; a compelling moral purpose ; a shared cause ; and the thrill of being forced by circumstances to put aside the pettiness and conflict of politics and to embrace a genuine moral and spiritual challenge . " <p> We agree wholeheartedly , and congratulate Al Gore and the IPCC on this historic recognition ! <h> 10/15/2007 07:57:00 AM <p> In partnership with Google.org , Technoserve recently completed the second Believe Begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its annual business plan competition . As a Google volunteer , I had an opportunity to interact with this years participants by teaching a class on presentation skills , judging the final round of the competition , and conducting one on one consulting sessions . I also visited the growing operations of 3 winners from last year and saw firsthand how the Believe Begin Become program has contributed to the success of their business . <p> I was both impressed and humbled by every entrepreneur I met . They all exhibited a level of energy , passion and enthusiasm that was overwhelmingly contagious . Operating in an environment where sound infrastructure is not a given , poverty is a reality , and health issues abound , they are seeking to create and build sustainable businesses that will change their community and their country for the better . <p> This years top winner of the overall business plan competition , Sheila Ocansey ( pictured below , left , with me , right ) , embodies this energy and passion . With FrutyFresh , she plans to package and distribute quality fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sheila was thoughtful enough to bring a sample of her product to her oral presentation , something that impressed all of the judges . I craved FrutyFresh fruit for its freshness , quality , and taste throughout the rest of my stay in Ghana . The other top winners include : Darko Abednego , Stanley Adjei , Yaw Agyei-Henaku , Joseph Brenyah , Savior Deikumah , Nikoe Gavu , Mary Koranteng , Daniel Oduro , and Joseph Tettey . <p> I observed firsthand the promise of what is possible for this years winners through visits with three winners from last year . Nicholas Vordzgbe of City Wash launched his mobile car wash service using a highly profitable , environmentally friendly approach to a common activity . City Wash is capable of washing an SUV with just 2 liters of water ! His next move includes opening a point of service location and expanding his mobile activities . Isaac Bohulu launched Natural Scientific Pharmaceuticals in a style characteristic of Silicon Valley . In a room that should have been his master bedroom , he is running a government approved production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made from completely natural ingredients . Finally , last years overall winner , Joseph Tackie of MeatyFoods , showed us how a shift in his marketing strategy allowed him to quintuple his revenues in one month . While we sampled the butchers spicy sausage , he told us of his plans to open his second store . <p> The Believe Begin Become program was launched with the hope that we would create an ecosystem of entrepreneurs , investors , customers , and employees that contribute to the growth and economic development of Ghana . Participating in the judging process , seeing the operations in action , and spending time with the entrepreneurs provided evidence that this is exactly what is happening . Participants from last year have become customers and/or suppliers of each other . Last years winner was a mentor to at least 3 of the winners from this year . The judges and potential investors have high standards ; not only are they funding these businesses , but they are personally engaged and interested in their success .

Back in 2008 , a team at Google dug into this behavior and found that certain search terms were good indicators of flu levels . We later launched Google Flu Trends to estimate flu activity in near real-time using aggregated Google search data , in regions around the world . <p> At the end of every flu season , we evaluate the performance of our model . Are our estimates accurate ? What worked well , or not so well ? Do we need to make any updates ? After the 2009 H1N1 season , for example , we updated the model to make sure we were providing accurate estimates . Since 2009 , the model had performed well at the national and regional levels in the US and no update was needed . <p> Flu Trends can help estimate the start , peak , and duration of each flu season--all important information for public health agencies . During the 2012-2013 season in the US , the model performed well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the model overestimated the severity of the flu . In January 2013 , after spotting the difference between our estimates and the percentage of healthcare visits for influenza-like illnesses ( ILI ) reported by the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) , we started to investigate the high estimates . We found that heightened media coverage on the severity of the flu season resulted in an extended period in which users were searching for terms we 've identified as correlated with flu levels . In early 2013 , we saw more flu-related searches in the US than ever before . <p> We evaluated several options to improve the model . Ultimately , we determined that an update using the peak from the 2012-2013 season provided a close approximation of flu activity for recent seasons . We will be applying this update to the US flu level estimates for the 2013-2014 flu season , starting from August 1st . A casual observer will see that the new model forecasts a lower flu level than last years model did at a similar time in the season . We believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can check out the new models estimates against previous years flu levels in this graph : <p> For those of you who want more data and details , we presented this paper recently at the ISNTD Bites conference .

That 's why the Google Crisis Response Team created Public Alerts and Crisis Map to help people better prepare for these unfortunate situations . Today , were launching Google Public Alerts and Crisis Map in Colombia to provide people with access to useful information before , during , and after a natural disaster such as a tropical storm , hurricane , flood or landslide.Starting today , relevant information about extreme weather changes which threaten the safety of Colombians will appear on Google Public Alerts as well as emergency related information for impacted areas on Crisis Map .

Could you pay ? What might you have to give up ? For billions of people , these costs--and questions--are an unaffordable reality that stop them from accessing the Web . <p> Today , Google is joining more than 30 members to launch the Alliance for Affordable Internet ( A4AI ) , a new coalition that cuts across boundaries of geography , sector , or size . Our goal ? To help bring down Internet costs through policy change . <p> New technologies play a crucial role in bringing the Internet to more people worldwide--weve developed and invested in many of these big ideas over the years .

Over 90% of people in the 49 least developed countries are still not online . A4AI wants to help people in these countries to get access , to find a door to new information , opportunities , and ideas . Dr. Bitange Ndemo , the honorary chairperson of A4AI , has called for the need to remove " analog policies that are holding back the digital revolution " in emerging markets .

Do not allow the electric and fuel cell vehicles sold in other states to count towards the credits for the California requirement ; placing vehicles in other states will not result in the necessary net improvements in California air quality . <p> 4 . Maintain the credit sunset for less efficient , lower power hybrids ; the current proposal asks to extend these credits indefinitely . <p> 5 . Do not increase the credits for Neighborhood Electric Vehicles ( low speed vehicles similar to electric golf carts ) ; they are not driven like full-function vehicles that are the focus of the ZEV Program . <p> To learn more about CARB , the ZEV mandate , and what you can do , check out a more detailed post on our new RechargeIT blog. <h> 3/20/2008 10:20:00 AM <p> Posted by the RechargeIT Team <p> Power on !

Dr. Brilliant also noted the importance of using new technologies for genetic detection . We know , for example , that over two-thirds of all new emerging diseases are of animal origin . By collecting and analyzing samples at the human/animal interface , we can begin to discover new viruses and study how they are able to jump species . He also discussed vulnerability mapping , a means to identify hot spots at increased risk .

The PTC and the ITC are tax incentives designed to spur the market for renewable energy and are critical to financing a new renewable energy generation . The credits are currently scheduled to expire on December 31 , 2008 . <p> Speaking at a news conference at the Washington International Renewable Energy Conference , Dan Reicher , Google.org 's Director of Climate Change and Energy Initiatives , said : " We are at the dawn of a green energy revolution that could fundamentally reshape the way the world generates energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to drive investment in clean energy and push these technologies out of the lab and into the mainstream . Policy makers can make or break this revolution . " <p> In a recent ACORE letter to Congress , over 350 industry leaders warned that a failure by Congress to immediately pass ITC/PTC extensions could jeopardize U.S. job creation and over 42,000 MW of planned renewable energy projects currently in development in 45 states . ( That 's an amount equivalent to 75 base load electricity generation stations and enough to power 16 million homes. )

The goals of the working group are to provide a platform for groups engaged in community forest monitoring activities - across continents - to share knowledge and experience . Equally important is for these groups to provide recommendations for the development of tools , methodologies , and common protocols . For example , the Surui tribe in the Brazilian Amazon is using modern technology to implement their communitys Surui Carbon Project . <p> This effort is n't isolated , as many NGOs and stakeholders support community-based approaches to forest monitoring for their efficiency , cultural relevance , and reliability . Community Forest Monitoring will play a role in the United Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation ( REDD+ ) effort which aims to incentivize developing countries to adopt a low-emission path to development . In thinking about best methods for data collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection issues including usability , security , accountability , cultural relevance , and scalability . <p> These are all concerns that the team at Open Data Kit ( ODK ) , an open source suite of data collection tools , have fleshed out and iterated upon . ODK was born in 2008 as a Google sabbatical project of University of Washington computer science professor Gaetano Borriello . Borriello wanted to take advantage of Googles data collection tools : maps , visualization , databases and has said that his team saw a gap in mobile data collection . Thus , Borriellos team developed ODK Build , ODK Collect , and ODK Aggregate , mobile tools that have attracted thousands of users and dozens of active developers . <p> As ODK iterates and evolves , the Public Sector Engineering team is learning about the challenges and opportunities in mobile data collection and exploring how we can contribute to this space . ODK already gives users the option to visualize data in Google Earth and Google Fusion Tables , and we are exploring how to take advantage of some of Googles other tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily posted to Picasa , or videos to YouTube ? ) Its our goal to make sure that all meaningful data is effectively organized and made discoverable , accessible and usable . <p> Ultimately , community forest monitoring represents just one slice of the potential that effective data collection tools create . ODK was initially motivated by the needs of community health workers and has proven flexible enough to be used to track everything from human rights violations in the Central African Republic to water quality in Ghana . As the nature of scientific research diversifies and the volume of data collected increases , reliable , flexible , and lightweight tools will become more and more crucial . <p> What 's next ? As the engineering teams continue to work on improving mobile data collection tools , this working group will convene policymakers at the next workshop to discuss standards and best practices . " The greatest barrier is n't a technological one , but the challenge of leveraging this data so that communities can help ensure better governance for their forests , " says Niki Mardas , Head of Strategy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with many other public data collection efforts , it will become the job of advocates and analysts to shape meaningful narratives and press for the change the world needs . We 're proud to be playing a part in this effort and we 're committed to working with our partners to transform data collection from a passive , closed process into an active and empowering one . <h> Tuesday 6/28/2011 07:00:00 AM <p> At Google , were committed to using technology to solve one of the greatest challenges we face as a country : building a clean energy future . That 's why we 've worked hard to be carbon neutral as a company , launched our renewable energy cheaper than coal initiative and have invested in several clean energy companies and projects around the world . <p> But what if we knew the value of innovation in clean energy technologies ? How much could new technologies contribute to our economic growth , enhance our energy security or reduce greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions ? Robust data can help us understand these important questions , and the role innovation in clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and climate challenges . <p> Through Google.org , our energy team set out to answer some of these questions . Using McKinseys Low Carbon Economics Tool ( LCET ) , we assessed the long-term economic impacts for the U.S. assuming breakthroughs were made in several different clean energy technologies , like wind , geothermal and electric vehicles . McKinseys LCET is a neutral , analytic set of interlinked models that estimates the potential economic and technology implications of various policy and technology assumptions . <p> The analysis is based on a model and includes assumptions and conclusions that Google.org developed , so it is n't a prediction of the future . Weve decided to make the analysis and associated data available everywhere because we believe it could provide a new perspective on the economic value of public and private investment in energy innovation . Here are just some of the most compelling findings : <p> Energy innovation pays off big : We compared " business as usual " ( BAU ) to scenarios with breakthroughs in clean energy technologies . On top of those , we layered a series of possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We found that by 2030 , when compared to BAU , breakthroughs could help the U.S. : <p> Reduce U.S. total carbon emissions by 13% in 2030 ( 21% with Clean Policy ) <p> Speed matters and delay is costly : Our model found a mere five year delay ( 2010-2015 ) in accelerating technology innovation led to $2.3-3.2 trillion in unrealized GDP , an aggregate 1.2-1.4 million net unrealized jobs and 8-28 more gigatons of potential GHG emissions by 2050 . <p> Policy and innovation can enhance each other : Combining clean energy policies with technological breakthroughs increased the economic , security and pollution benefits for either innovation or policy alone . Take GHG emissions : the model showed that combining policy and innovation led to 59% GHG reductions by 2050 ( vs. 2005 levels ) , while maintaining economic growth . <p> This analysis assumed that breakthroughs in clean energy happened and that policies were put in place , and then tried to understand the impact . The data here allows us to imagine a world in which the U.S. captures the potential benefits of some clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction in harmful emissions . We have n't developed the roadmap , and getting there will take the right mix of policies , sustained investment in technological innovation by public and private institutions and mobilization of the private sectors entrepreneurial energies . We hope this analysis encourages further discussion and debate on these important issues . <h> Monday 6/20/2011 11:53:00 AM <p> Earlier this month , thousands of " hackers for good " gathered in more than 19 different global locationsfrom Berlin to Nairobi , and Sydney to Sao Pauloto participate in Random Hacks of Kindness #3 .

Were always excited to hear about researchers using this data and recently learned about a study which compares Google Flu Trends estimates of flu activity with estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . <p> Almost any public health expert will tell you that there is n't a single perfect measure of flu activity . Instead , there are several good measures , each of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flu activity emerges when these stories are examined together . One such measure is the CDCs influenza-like illness surveillance network ( ILINet ) which shows the proportion of people who visit a physician with flu-like symptoms such as fever , cough and sore throat . This network can highlight areas where activity is unusually high given the time of year but can not provide insight into the specific pathogens which are causing the illness . Another is the CDCs Virologic Surveillance which shows the proportion of people who visit a physician , get tested , and have lab-confirmed influenza . This network shows the specific strains of influenza in circulation but can be affected by changes in testing practices , making it difficult to interpret the data over long periods of time . <p> We collaborated with the CDC when designing Google Flu Trends and decided to build a system that would make estimates based on the CDCs ILINet data . Historically , we 've shown a strong correlation with CDCs ILINet data , typically with a correlation of greater than 0.9 ( or more than 90% accurate as compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google Flu Trends is 72% accurate as compared with CDC 's Virologic Surveillance data . This does n't come as much of a surprise since the virologic data is telling a different story than the ILInet data .

Google Flu Trends helps paint the picture of flu activity by providing estimates daily while some traditional flu surveillance systems can take days or weeks to collect and release data . <h> Monday 5/03/2010 11:02:00 AM <p> ( Cross-posted from the Official Google Blog to bring you information on other green efforts at Google ) <p> On Friday we made our first direct investment in a utility-scale renewable energy project two wind farms that generate 169.5 megawatts of power , enough to power more than 55,000 homes .

Our web-based services run in some of the worlds most efficient data centers , we deploy renewable energy where viable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we cant otherwise eliminate . <p> Even with these efforts , however , there remains an urgent need for clean , affordable electricity . To that end we have a team of engineers working to develop technology breakthroughs that will help make carbon-free electricity an economically viable alternative to electricity from coal . <p> Were also putting our experience with organizing information to work , so we can enable others to do projects in the sustainable space . We recently announced , for example , Earth Engine , a computational platform that enables global-scale monitoring and measurement of changes in the Earths forests . And were working with our peers through Climate Savers Computing to cut the power used by computers in half . <p> We also want to help you achieve your personal energy reduction targets . Most people do n't  know their own direct energy footprint , so we launched Google PowerMeter to give detailed , near real-time information about home energy usage . We also like to encourage everyone to set their computers power management to avoid wasting electricity when its not being used . <p> Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago when I was a teenager and living under their roof . They were often exasperated to find the lights on in rooms I 'd just left , and it took years for them to convince me that I could choose something to eat without standing in front of the fridge with the door wide open . The point is , I had to learn to become a steward of the environment . We can help many more people take steps toward better care of the environment , and make that learning curve easier to climb . <p> Turning off the lights wont solve the climate crisis , but its a start . Earth Hour gives individuals a simple , meaningful way to participate in a global call for change . As U.N . Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated , " Earth Hour is a way for the citizens of the world to send a clear message they want action on climate change . " <p> So I hope you 'll gather your friends and family and join me , and hundreds of millions of others , in turning off the lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Tuesday 3/23/2010 03:07:00 PM <p> At Google , we are encouraged to experiment and tinker to see if there is a better way of doing things . We want to encourage others in the energy monitoring space to do the same . To this end , I 'd like to introduce our most recent strategic partner Microchip , which is a supplier of cost-effective , innovative products for the embedded developer . Today , Microchip will include as part of their developer demonstration environment the Google PowerMeter API library that we recently announced . This integration will make it much easier to create devices compatible with Google PowerMeter which means one can more quickly go from concept to demo to product . <p> The Google PowerMeter API is designed to work with a variety of energy monitoring devices - from utilities with smart meters , back haul networks and enterprise scale meter data management systems - to small embedded consumer devices that can send energy information directly to Google PowerMeter . <p> Google 's belief in open source also means that the Google PowerMeter API library is available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinkerers and makers are welcome to explore the code and use it in their products . <p> As we search for clean energy alternatives , it is important that everyone - from utilities to garage inventors - get a chance to try out new technologies and methods so that we all benefit from their inspirations . <h> Monday 3/15/2010 05:41:00 PM <p> Google PowerMeter now gives you the ability to share your data with others . What does this mean ? Everyone in your household can now activate Google PowerMeter on her own personalized iGoogle page so families and roommates can all track their energy consumption online together . <p> You can also share your data with friends or other Google PowerMeter users to get advice on your usage , compare trends or even strike up a friendly competition to see who can save the most . After all , how can you keep up with your friends , the Joneses , when you do n't know how much they are consuming ? <p> Members of the Google PowerMeter team routinely compare their energy usage data and share energy saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by comparing his PowerMeter data with his friend 's data during a heat wave , a fellow Googler discovered that his home air-conditioning system was consuming much more energy than his friend 's system . The friend lives in the same area and in a similar sized house . By sharing this data , the Googler found out that his air conditioner was malfunctioning , and after making the necessary repairs , was able to reduce the amount he spends on electricity for air conditioning . <p> All sharing is completely opt-in and your privacy will still be protected .

Our founders have set a goal of devoting approximately 1% of Google 's equity and yearly profits to philanthropy . In 2009 , we devoted around $100 million plus in-kind giving to a broad range of philanthropic efforts . Here are some highlights : <p> Academic scholarships and awards : We provide scholarships to encourage students of various backgrounds , ethnicities and gender to excel in their studies in hopes that these and other programs will help dismantle barriers that keep women and minorities from entering computing and technology fields . <p> Academic grants : We support the next generation of engineers and maintain strong ties with academic institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mission . We fund projects across a variety of subjects , host visiting faculty members at Google , and have launched the Google Fellowship Program to fund graduate students doing innovative research in several fields . <p> Holiday charitable gift : We made $22 million in donations in 2009 to a couple of dozen deserving charities around the world to help organizations that have been stretched thin by more requests for help in a year of fewer donations . <p> Employee gift matching : Google matches up to $6,000 for each employee 's annual charitable contributions and contributes $50 for every five hours an employee volunteers through our " Dollars for Doers " program to encourage employee participation in charitable causes . <p> Charitable Giving Council : We support grants for Googler-led partnerships on causes such as K-12 educational initiatives in science , math and technology . <p> Community affairs : We invest in communities where Google has a presence around the world , creating opportunities for Googlers to invest time and expertise , engage in local grant making and build partnerships with local stakeholders . <p> In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to free tools to help charitable groups promote their cause , raise money , collaborate with others and operate more efficiently . Google Grants , for example , offers in-kind AdWords advertising to non-profit organizations . Since the program began , we 've donated over $625 million worth of AdWords advertising to all kinds of charitable organizations . <h> Wednesday 3/03/2010 09:55:00 AM <p> Today we 're excited to introduce the Google PowerMeter API on code.google.com , for developers interested in integrating with Google PowerMeter . This API will allow device manufacturers to build home energy monitoring devices that work with Google PowerMeter . We 're launching this API in order to help build the ecosystem of innovative developers working towards making energy information more widely available to consumers . <p> In today 's launch of the API on code.google.com we are highlighting the core design principles towards integrating with Google PowerMeter . In particular we outline the underlying data model and the accompanying protocols to ensure that Google PowerMeter provides consumers access to their energy consumption with utmost care in maintaining the user 's privacy and control on access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samples and client implementations , how to easily start building your PowerMeter-compatible device . <p> Tune into our blog and subscribe to our notification list for announcements on upcoming developments .

And we are reminded of how important it is to respond directly to the current flooding in Pakistan and the many humanitarian crises that continue today . <p> There are also many ways to have an impact on humanitarian crises from afar . In the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Rig explosion , for example , the Defenders of Wildlife ( and latest Google Earth Hero ) built the Gulf Oil Spill Recovery map to track restoration efforts from citizens , nonprofits and government agencies . <p> Humanitarian workers are deeply involved in solutions to the global challenges being addressed by the Millennium Development Goals .

The latest estimate of the number of people affected by the flood exceeds 14 millionmore than the combined total of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , the 2005 Kashmir earthquake and the 2010 Haiti earthquake . Critical infrastructure has been damaged over the last two weeks and clean water is in short supply . As monsoons approach , flooding is expected to worsen . <p> Our Crisis Response team has been working to use existing tools and build new ones to help the relief efforts . We just launched a page in Urdu and English where you can find information , resources and donation opportunities to help the victims of the floods . Were also donating $250,000 to international and local NGOs to immediately aid in relief efforts . Although we 've been able to provide satellite imagery for disasters in the past , cloud cover in Pakistan has prevented us from compiling useful imagery so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . <p> We 've already learned a lot about building useful tools from our previous efforts to help with disaster relief . Following the earthquake in Haiti , a small team of Googlers visited relief aid workers in Haiti to understand how we could further help . In observing and speaking with the relief aid workers , we learned that they needed up-to-date information about available resources ( such as which field hospitals have X-ray machines or orthopedic surgeons ) , their location and contact information . Coordination between various health and relief facilities that spring up in a disaster zone can be challenging . <p> Based on what we learned in Haiti , we 've been working to develop Resource Finder , a new tool to help disseminate updated information about which services various health facilities offer . It provides a map with editable records to help relief workers maintain up-to-date information on the services , doctors , equipment and beds available at neighboring health facilities so that they can efficiently arrange patient transfers . We normally would n't release the tool so quickly , but decided to make an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pakistan . This is the first time the tool is being launched during a disaster situation so well be working closely with NGOs to understand its usefulness and will iterate accordingly . <p> We 've also launched Person Finder in both Urdu and English for this disaster .

Fortunately , we 've heard that missing persons has not been as concerning an issue as it was during the earthquakes in Haiti and Chile , but well leave the application up regardless . <p> Responding to a disaster of this scale is a daunting task , but we can all do something to help . We will try to do our part and continue working with the many incredible NGOs to develop tools that help them work more effectively . <h> Thursday 8/12/2010 10:09:00 AM <p> I 've learned a lot as an intern with Google.orgs health efforts the last few months . Just this week I learned about a new collaboration between Google.org grantee HealthMap - the same group mentioned in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dengue Branch of the US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control ( CDC ) . Theyve created DengueMap to show recent reports of dengue around the world and regions where people are at risk to catch it . The reports on DengueMap are updated multiple times a day , keeping you up-to-date on where dengue is . <p> One week ago , I barely knew a thing about dengue . It turns out 2.5 billion people around the world are at risk of contracting dengue , and 50 to 100 million people get sick from it every year . Dengue is present in more than 100 countries , and dengue is on the rise in many parts of the world . This even includes the US . According to the CDC , there have been 28 cases where people caught dengue in Florida since 2009 . While this does n't  sound like a lot of cases , its somewhat alarming given that there were only a handful of cases ever recorded before 2009 . <p> Dengue thrives in both cities and rural areas of the tropics and subtropics and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The symptoms are similar to a severe flu , and can be quite painful . There is no cure and no vaccine . Fortunately , dengue rarely causes death , though severe complications , like dengue hemorrhagic fever , can be lethal . <p> The bottom line ? Be smart about protecting yourself from dengue . Know the areas where dengue is present ( DengueMap is helpful for this ) and wear bug spray . <p> Indeed , we believe our work in clean energy is good for business . We made the decision to become carbon neutral in 2007 . We are minimizing our energy consumption with some of the most energy efficient data centers in the world , lowering our energy costs . And we are purchasing carbon offsets for the emissions we cant eliminate . We also seek to power our facilities with renewable energy , like one of the largest corporate solar installations at our headquarters in Mountain View , CA . And were making investments in renewable energy , such as our $38.8 million investment in two North Dakota wind farms , and our recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year period , spurring real growth in the sector by giving the developer financial certainty to develop new projects . <p> As a technology company , we 've seen how the power of innovation can change the way we live our lives . Eric Schmidt said it best : " In Silicon Valley , it was the limitations of one technology or system that served as the drivers of change and led to the success of our industries here . AB32 provides a similar opportunity for new job creation in many sectors as business responds to the need for energy-efficient buildings , transportation and a growing portfolio of renewable energy resources . " <p> Were committed to finding the right solutions to a clean energy future and we hope Californias policies continue to lead the way . <h> Friday 8/06/2010 11:59:00 AM <p> According to the UN , the recent floods in Pakistan have affected over 4 million individuals - and the human toll continues to grow .

In Pakistan , however , the cloud cover over the impacted areas has inhibited our ability to make this valuable content available . The Crisis Response team is looking to collect and aggregate imagery and user generated KML , or other map data , with the goal of making this content more accessible to both crisis responders and the general public . Were hoping you can help . You can submit links to KML and map data via the following form . Well contact you if we are able to publish your content . <p> Further , we 've released a version of our Person Finder tool in Urdu . We realize many of the victims of this disaster lack any connectivity to the Internet , but remain hopeful that tools like this can assist the diaspora and general disaster community in collecting and dispersing information on the well-being of those impacted . <p> Your data might help relief efforts ; we appreciate you sharing it with the world .

" <h> 9/12/2007 08:39:00 AM <p> Posted by Kirsten Olsen <p> Since Google.org launched the RechargeIT initiative in June as part of our efforts to stop global warming , a lot has happened in the world of plug-in vehicles . Automakers have made key announcements about future plans for plug-ins . Our grantee , the Electric Power Research Institute ( EPRI ) , along with Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) , released a comprehensive assessment that found that widespread use of plug-in hybrids could dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions . The charge for electrified transportation is heating up , and we could n't be more excited . But consumers still ca n't buy plug-in vehicles and that 's a problem . It 's time for us to put some money where our mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Today , Google.org has issued a request for investment proposals ( RFP ) to the tune of $10 million in order to advance sustainable transportation solutions . We are inviting entrepreneurs and companies to show us their best ideas on how they can contribute to this important cause . We need catalytic investments to support technologies , products and services that are critical to accelerating plug-in vehicle commercialization . That is why we have structured this RFP to offer investment dollars to for-profit companies to promote social and environmental change . The severity of global warming requires solutions from NGOs , governments , individuals and ( very importantly ) the private sector . We have already made $1 million in grants to a group of outstanding non-profit organizations , and want to expand our impact by spurring innovation in the private sector . While $10 million is a fraction of the total investment needed to transform our transportation sector , we hope this RFP will help catalyze a broader response . We need the automakers to bring these cars to market , but plug-in vehicles also need an entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type of open call for proposals is not the usual model for investment , but we wanted to use a process that was open to new ideas and new entrants . Part of our goal is to get as many people as possible to work on solutions to our vehicle emissions challenges . We welcome and expect to receive submissions from a wide variety of companies -- from cutting edge battery technologies to innovative service businesses and from companies of all sizes . We also encourage participants from all over the world to submit proposals . This is a global challenge , and it will take all of us to solve it . <p> This open RFP process is a new approach to mission-focused investing , and we 're interested to see what we can learn from it , both in terms of opportunities and gaps that exist in this space today , as well as ways that we can improve on this solicitation process for future investments . Our focus on learning is the primary reason we decided to narrow this first RFP to investments in private companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We will continue to make grants as part of RechargeIT and other programs , but we 're excited today to announce our first foray into investments.To learn more , read the RFP . <h> Monday 9/10/2007 11:11:00 AM <p> Posted by Daniel Conrad , Senior Business Analyst , Google <p> Joseph Tackie is the CEO of Meaty Foods Limited , a high-end butcher in Ghana .

He told me about the progress of his business one year since his graduation . <p> DC : I heard that you quintupled sales in one month after winning seed capital from BBB last year . How on earth ? <p> JT : See , the difficulty of our environment is that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect you to have already made it , to have already become successful before they invest . They are not going to finance your marketing . With the seed capital from BBB , I was able to create a very good billboard . That 's all it took . People would see the billboard and come in and want to see what it was that we were doing . And our sales quintupled in just one month . <p> Three weeks ago I got my certification from the Ghanaian Standards Board . It cost a lot of money , and this is the type of thing that nobody will finance because they see you as a start-up . Now I can sell to any supermarket in Ghana.When you are a start-up , none of the banks wants to do business with you . But with a little success , now they are chasing you to do business with them . <p> DC : What are your future plans for your business ? <p> JT : First , we are developing our outlets . We have one store now , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We also have a request to set up a similar processing facility in Mali . They have lots of beef in Mali but no high-end processing . <p> DC : What did you learn from the BBB program ? <p> JT : What really made the difference with the program was the networking . Because the program is organized by entrepreneurs it is very practical . They are like role models . Your anxieties are things they have experienced , so you can share with them . <p> Working with entrepreneurs breaks down the fears and anxieties . Issues to do with risks are minimized . You are exposed to success . A lot of people are afraid to venture because of the losses they have dealt with . But working with other entrepreneurs enables you to look forward . The obstacles will always be there , but you will be equipped to go around them . <p> There have been a lot of people saying foreign aid is bad . But this is different . It is like you are teaching me to fish . This BBB program empowered me.

Their most common request was for visualizations that enable easy comparison of flu levels across regions , so that differences in the trend of the season could be easily identified . We now publish the flu levels of all countries and regions on Google Public Data Explorer which provides this feature and much more .

@@13269021 @1869021/ <h> Friday 4/02/2010 12:22:00 PM <p> The international community likes to define Liberias recent history primarily through two events : its fourteen-year civil war , which ended in 2003 , and the work of the countrys president , Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , the first democratically elected female leader in Africa . The chart below illustrates both . On my recent trip to Liberia , first with a group of Bay Area philanthropists hosted by the government and then as part of a small group of Googlers on a country visit , I learned more about how terrible the 1980s and 90s were in this small West African nation . GDP -- a crude measure of the health of a nation , but an indicator nonetheless -- dropped 90% as the country endured brutal dictatorship after brutal dictatorship . That decline is the largest in any nation since World War II , and nearly twice the percentage drop that Rwanda , Zimbabwe , and other states experienced during their crises . The good news is that although Liberia essentially had no economy at the depths of the war , GDP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and foreign direct investment has returned . <p> The numbers also tell a third story . Throughout the 1960s and 70s Liberias economy grew at a steady pace in a way that most other African economies did not . The growth was inequitable -- but real -- and the ingenuity and entrepreneurship that drove it are on full display today , albeit in ways that can sometimes puzzle a visitor to the country . <p> During the ten days I was in Liberia my colleagues and I always had a driver ; its the only way for foreigners to get around . The first day we reserved our car for 9:00am but when I looked out the hotel window at 9:02am I noticed the car speeding off with three other passengers . When I frantically called the driver he responded , " My man , do n't  worry -- I will get you to your meeting on time . " And he did . Then there was the night a local friend suggested dinner by saying , " Come on -- this place has a nice outdoor patio at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did n't  quite sound as inviting as I meant it . " When we arrived our waiter was Frankie , a cheerful eight-year old sporting an Alex Rodriguez Yankees jersey who delivered our food and drink on the jog . At the local family restaurant , everyone pitched in . <p> Like most of Africa , cell phones are ubiquitous in Liberia and are the technology of choice for the vast majority of the population . Our meetings with the mobile providers there could have taken place anywhere in the world . They 're making money but are fiercely competitive with one another , slashing prices and offering new products to gain market share , and desperately trying to expand into new markets like broadband . Their activities are far from philanthropic , but they 're arguably having a more positive affect on Liberians day-to-day life than any other segment of society . The mobile penetration rate is 40% and rising , particularly in rural areas where phones are often the first " big " purchase a Liberian will make . <p> The countrys trademark ingenuity is of course noticeable here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different mobile carriers and switch back and forth depending on coverage and prices ( a noticeably nice option that 's not available in the locked-down U.S. market ) . Since unanswered calls do n't  incur a charge and the person who initiates the call pays more than the receiver , Liberians will also occasionally call and hang up , meaning , " I want talk to you but you can afford this more than I can , so call me back . " Scratch cards , which give you twenty or thirty minutes of talk time , are practically used as cash and are sold virtually everywhere . <p> The past thirty years have been difficult ones for most Liberians , and with an 80% unemployment rate and known war criminals still occupying high government offices , there are still huge problems to address . In the next two years the country will hold elections and most of the UN peacekeepers will withdraw . Watch closely : if both go well , a stable Liberia may finally be back .

Here 's what I found : <p> First , what exactly are green jobs and what can they do to spur the U.S. economy and stop climate change ? Simply put , green jobs are jobs that are good for the environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage . In a recent New York Times article entitled , Millions of Jobs of a Different Collar , the Sierra Clubs Carl Pope stated , " A green job has to do something useful for people , and it has to be helpful to , or at least not damaging to , the environment . " <p> Can the fight against global warming really create millions of these green jobs across America ? With worry about the economy on the rise , it is certainly a hopeful scenario . A recent article in the Oakland Tribune suggests that experts envision just such a future : " If global warming is to be slowed , it will take wholesale change in how electricity is generated , how people travel and how they heat and cool their houses . That means installing hundreds of millions of solar panels , building thousands of wind farms and geothermal plants , engineering new ways to derive energy from renewable sources and weatherizing millions of homes . Green companies are rapidly hiring new workers and indications are they will continue . " <p> For those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please check out my longer post on the potential number of jobs created by a cleaner , greener economy . And have a happy Earth Day ! <h> Friday 4/18/2008 01:32:00 PM <p> Google Earth is a great tool for exploring the world in ways never before possible . Many of the non-profits and other public-benefit organizations that we work with find it especially useful for showing people the remote places where they work and telling their stories in a very compelling way . <p> Have you ever looked at the amazing high-resolution images in Google Earth and wondered when the photo was taken ? Well now you can stop wondering ! Google Earth 4.3 was launched this week , and one of the many new features is the " imagery acquisition date . " <p> Simply zoom in on and move your mouse cursor over the high-resolution imagery ; the status bar will display the date when the imagery was acquired . This will be especially useful for organizations concerned about changes in the environment . <p> For anyone interested in learning more about Google Earth , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woof of Map Action has written a great paper ( 1MB PDF ) that you should check out . It looks at Google Earth 's differences from and relationship with traditional Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) software , and how it can be used in humanitarian relief and other public benefit work . <h> 4/11/2008 01:16:00 PM <p> Two members of our team recently attended an international conference at the Carter Center on the right to information ( RTI ) . I must admit that I did n't have much knowledge in this area and did n't even realize that the US passed the Freedom of Information Act ( FOAI ) more than 40 years ago . Today , roughly 70 countries have adopted legislation that theoretically gives their citizens the right to ask for and receive from their governments information on any number of issues , including property records , tax files , and identity files . <p> This may sound rather vague and unimportant . But in some developing countries access to birth certificates can be critical in getting access to basic public services like immunizations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when seeking loans ) . For the poor , this access is particularly important , but finding even simple records of identity can be much harder than you might imagine . The ability of bureaucrats to control access to what is " public " puts them in position to make all kinds of demands . For example , getting access to a birth certificate ( technically a public record ) can take months , involve dozens of steps , and include bribes at every stage . Without basic identify documents , the poor are often left without access to essential public services reserved for " official citizens " . <p> Governments increasingly are putting public information online , even in the developing world . However , " online " does n't always mean searchable or crawlable . In other words , you have to know where it is to find it . How would you even know where to look ? Participants at the conference were captivated by the idea of making high value , high impact public records like land registries and identify documents available online in a format @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience in digitizing books and making them available online was cited as the kind of effort that could be useful in helping give people in developing countries access to the public information they need . There is some work already happening at Google on making government records crawlable . <p> The possibility is exciting . Could poor rural people get access to birth certificates , death certificates or land titles one day through their mobile phones ? It 's worth thinking about . Even if they have to pay to access them , the cost of getting access to critical data at important times would more than pay for itself . As the penetration of mobile phones in rural areas has shown , people are willing to pay for access to tools and information that give them what they want when they need it most . <h> Monday 4/07/2008 08:41:00 AM <p> Posted by Amy Luers , Program Manager , Google.org <p> The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has dedicated today , World Health Day 2008 , to raising awareness of the health risks of global climate change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're glad WHO and its member countries are using today to bring the linkage to the forefront . <p> Climates effects on health are wide reaching . Climate affects the quality of air we breathe and the quantity and quality of water resources . It affects the productivity of agriculture , distribution of pests and disease , and the severity and frequency of heatwaves , droughts , floods , and wildfires . As a result , climate change is not just an environmental issue but fundamentally a human health and livelihoods issue . <p> We are already experiencing the impacts of climate change across the globe . In fact , a WHO report concluded the climate changes since the mid-1970s may have caused about 150,000 deaths in 2000 . The impacts of climate change are disproportionately felt in the poorest regions of the world . <p> Change in WHO estimated mortality per year ( per million people ) attributable to climate change by the year 2000 . This map is based on WHO data for climate-sensitive health outcomes including : cardiovascular diseases , diarrhea , malaria , inland and coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of climate and health . <p> The global community is just beginning to understand the impact that continued climate change is likely to have on the distribution of infectious diseases . Check out the post by our mapping specialists where they describe the Google Earth layers they developed with scientists researching the affects climate may have on dengue and malaria transmission . You can also download these Google Earth layers here . <p> While some climate change impacts on public health and the environment are now unavoidable due to our past emissions of greenhouse gases , the severity of the impacts will depend on actions we take today to both reduce future emissions and prepare for the changes ahead . At Google.org we are working to reduce greenhouse gas emission by developing utility-scale renewable energy cheaper than coal and accelerating the commercialization of plug-in vehicles through the RechargeIT initiative , while the Predict and Prevent initiative team is working to help prepare the world 's poor to manage the rising number emerging infectious diseases in our rapidly changing world . <h> 4/07/2008 08:32:00 AM <p> With the World Health Organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climate change and health today , we wanted to show you some cool animated Google Earth layers that illustrate how infectious diseases may spread as the earth warms . Warmer climates make good habitats for mosquitoes . Many diseases , such as dengue fever and malaria , are spread by mosquitoes . As the planet continues to get warmer due to greenhouse gas emissions , these diseases are projected to spread and add to the other burdens of climate change , especially in the developing world . <p> The Google Earth ( KML ) file linked below will show you projections for the changes in transmission of dengue fever around the globe and of malaria in Africa and specifically Zimbabwe . These layers were created in collaboration with a number of scientists whose studies provided the data , including Simon Hales , Frank Tanser and Kris Ebi . There 's also a layer that shows the estimated deaths related to climate change in the year 2000 . <p> To view the layers , download this KML file and open it in Google Earth on your computer .

The Chevy Volt is a plug-in extended-range electric vehicle that operates on a combination of gasoline ( biodiesel , E85 , and gasoline fuels ) and electricity . Its large lithium-ion battery pack allows it to run only on electricity for up to 40 miles . Since 78% of U.S. commuters drive 40 miles or less from work , charging overnight can provide enough energy for most daily commutes . On longer trips , the car uses its combustion engine as a " range extender " but GM still expects it to get about 150 miles per gallon . According to GM , the Volt is expected to save drivers 570 gallons ( or $1368 per year , electricity included ) in fuel cost . <p> Googlers were invited to check out the Volt and ask GM representatives questions about the vehicle as part an effort to showcase different green technologies and educate employees about their potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plug-ins in the coming years , and we look forward to checking out other models on our campus as they become available . However , we also hope to see commitments to a schedule of production from the auto-makers so that cars like the Volt will be more than just displays on our campus . Plug-in vehicles are an important solution for reducing emissions produced by the transportation sector . Of course , by reducing emissions , we reduce our dependence on oil . We are happy to see auto-makers working to make this solution a reality . <h> Monday 12/17/2007 08:25:00 AM <p> Posted by Michael Terrell , Team Member , Google.org <p> It came down to the 11th hour , and then dragged on for an extra day -- but after two weeks of negotiations , delegates at the UN climate change conference in Bali settled on a plan for reaching a new international agreement to fight climate change . The Bali action plan provides a roadmap for negotiating an expanded and strengthened international emissions reduction pact by the end of 2009 . <p> The deal leaves many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions reductions goals or targets ; in fact the scientific recommendations on the emissions reductions needed to halt climate change are relegated to a footnote . The plan simply lays out a process to negotiate the emissions targets to succeed the limits set by Kyoto Protocol , which expire in 2012 . It also provides a platform to begin talks to address growing concerns about adaption , deforestation and facilitating transfer of clean technologies to developing countries . <p> At the outset of this conference , we noted that the scale and complexity of the climate crisis demands collective action by the world 's governments . The Bali roadmap , while leaving much to be desired , represents an important step in this process . All the parties are still at the table and are now committed to spending the next two years crafting a more comprehensive global solution to fighting climate change . Many were hopeful that the outcome of the U.S. Presidential election in 2008 will help breathe new life into this process , regardless of whether the President-elect is a Republican or Democrat . <p> But given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how acrimonious the negotiations were , the rest of us ca n't afford to wait for the world to negotiate a new climate agreement . We need to take action now . Fortunately , many people around the world are doing just that . The numerous panels and side events at Bali were filled with examples of concrete actions people are taking now to build a cleaner future . We wrote on how the world 's local governments are launching their own initiatives to fight global warming and how others are working to ensure that any solutions take into account equity and justice considerations . Another hot topic of conversation here was the growing efforts of many companies to reduce their carbon footprints and take a leadership role in promoting smart energy policies . <p> The flurry of activity among all of these groups is encouraging . The result at Bali and the tough road ahead suggests that the international treaty process will not be sufficient to confront this challenge with the speed and scope with which it demands , at least in the short term . To stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether by making choices to reduce our personal carbon footprint , engaging with family and friends in our communities , or elevating the climate crisis to the top of the political agenda . For the Google.org team , it means a renewed commitment to putting our own resources to work . <h> Thursday 12/13/2007 09:15:00 AM <p> Posted by Kirsten Olsen , Project Manager , Google.org <p> Though all 15,000 participants of the UN climate conference have come to Bali to discuss the global response to climate change , there are many points of entry to the debate . Some enter through the policy door , seeking better rules to mandate emissions reductions . Others enter through the investment door , seeking profit from carbon markets and clean technologies . And an increasing number of participants come through the global development door , seeking " climate justice " for poor populations effected by global warming . As Meena Raman of Friends of the Earth International in Malaysia explained , " We all agree that climate change is happening , but now we have to ask the question of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how large that " burden of adjustment " will be is uncertain , but the UN Human Development Report released in anticipation of UN Conference proclaims that " climate change is the defining human development challenge of the 21st Century " and that " failure to respond to that challenge will stall and then reverse international efforts to reduce poverty . " The idea of climate justice comes into play when considering who will pay for climate adaptation when those countries that have done the least to cause global warming bear the greatest cost . Different groups here in Bali have even attempted to put a dollar amount to the cost of adaptation . Oxfam , for example , estimates the cost to be $50 billion per year and far more if emissions are not cut rapidly . <p> For many NGOs in Bali , climate change offers an opportunity to engage a new community of stakeholders and introduce ideas of environmental equity into the debate . Victoria Tauli-Corpuz , the Chairperson of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues , described the phenomenon as a " moment to challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indonesian Civil Society Forum for Climate Justice have sprung up in the past year to address the climate challenge while more established NGOs such as UNICEF have begun to incorporate work on climate justice and adaptation into their work . <p> Even though several side events and exhibit booths here in Bali focus on climate justice and adaptation , they are still a relatively small percentage of the overall NGO representation at the conference . Michael Dorsey from Dartmouth College and the Durban Group for Climate Justice points out that the International Emissions Trading Association ( IETA ) still dominates in Bali with 336 representatives making up 8% of all NGOs listed . That is equal to more than the delegation of Greenpeace ( 2% ) , the World Wildlife Fund ( 1.6% ) and Friends of the Earth ( 1.5% ) combined . <p> One silver lining that is gaining momentum here in Bali is the idea of " green jobs " created in the new energy economy . Most admit that further research on this topic is necessary to determine which sectors of society will benefit most from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice advocates in search for solutions . <h> Monday 12/10/2007 05:18:00 PM <p> Posted by David Bercovich , Project Manager , Google.org <p> The theme today in Bali perhaps could best be summarized by the bumper sticker maxim , " think globally , act locally . " While the delegates continued negotiations on an international climate change agreement , several events highlighted efforts by local communities around the world to confront the climate crisis and secure their own clean energy future . <p> Local cities from Milano , Italy to Betim , Brazil to Bhubaneswar , India shared their experiences deploying renewable energy projects in their cities . In partnership with ICLEI , they have banded together with other cities around the world ( ICLEI map below of participating cities below ) to share expertise and best practices on renewable energy and energy efficiency . <p> The U.S. Climate Acton Network highlighted efforts by U.S. states ( including 9 of the country 's 10 largest emitting states ) to reduce emissions , along with the pledge by over 700 U.S. mayors to meet the Kyoto Protocol targets in their cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Berkeley 's solar home financing plan ; Chapel Hill , North Carolina 's free public transit ; and the City of Austin 's plan to power all city facilities with 100% renewable power . <p> The flurry of local activity represents some frustration with the pace of international action , according to German Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul . " We ca n't wait for every detail to be correct at the international level ; we have to act now and we can act now if we act locally . " Monika Zimmermann of ICLEI hopes the ' can-do ' attitude of state and local governments will be contagious . " We 're not just doing the right thing for our own sake , we want to prompt national governments and the international community to follow our lead . " <h> Wednesday 12/05/2007 05:59:00 PM <p> Posted by Michael Terrell , Team Member , Google.org <p> This week , representatives from 190 countries are gathering in Bali , Indonesia to begin framing an international climate change agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol , which expires in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activists , local politicians , NGOs , businesses and others -- responding to the call for action . <p> The talks come on the heels of a comprehensive assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) that presents the most sobering news on global warming to date . The IPCC , recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize , concluded that evidence of global warming is " unequivocal , " with 90% certainty that humans are the cause . According to IPCC Chairman Rajendra Pachauri , urgent action is needed to combat climate change , or the consequences for the planet could be " disastrous . " <p> The good news is that the IPCC has identified a wide a range of solutions for curbing greenhouse gas emissions that are both technologically feasible and economically competitive . Here at Google we are working to accelerate some of these technologies through our our recently announced Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal initiative , Google.org 's RechargeIT program , and our 1.6 MW solar installation . <p> But our own efforts can only get us so far .

According to the article , several hundred cases of chikungunya fever -- a virus that in past has only been common in Africa and Asia -- have been reported recently in Italy . Rising temperatures are creating new breeding grounds for diseases to emerge , and the expanded movement of people and goods are increasing disease spread worldwide . <p> This European outbreak is one of a series of recent warning signs of the mounting risks that our changing climate poses to human health .

The bad news is that even with aggressive global action to reduce emissions , the climate will continue to change for decades as a result of previous emissions . Scientific research suggests that if actions could be taken to immediately stop the rise in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations , the inertia of the climate system is such that 0.5C ( 0.9F ) or more of additional global average warming would still occur . <p> One thing is certain : the future will hold more changes and more surprises , and we need to be prepared . Those of us on the Google.org team are working at the intersection of climate change , global public health , and poverty to help reduce the vulnerability of the world 's poor to the emerging diseases of the future .

I saw a link between their needs and the condition of the land and thought , " Why not plant trees to address these issues ? " Trees hold the soil to the ground so that we can grow food in it , they protect watersheds and facilitate harvesting of rain water , fruits trees supplement food and trees give us domestic energy and wood with which to build our shelters .

The population has swelled to 100,000 from approximately 70,000 largely because of refugees fleeing the post-election violence in other parts of Kenya . Local authorities expect to see that population double over the next ten years . Providing public services , especially water and sanitation , to this growing population is an enormous challenge . <p> In 2000 , the international community made a commitment to the UN Millennium Development Goals to help communities access basic public services , like health , education , water and sanitation . One the key milestones of Goal 7 is to " halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 . " As of 2004 , the MDG Monitor shows the nations bordering Lake Victoria- Uganda , Tanzania and Kenya only 60% of their populations have access to improved drinking water sources . <p> While great progress is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60% of their population has adequate service , despite what the official statistics say . New water pipes have been donated to the local water provider . This has doubled the capacity , but it only reaches half of Kisii 's estimated population ( 50,000 ) . Water kiosks stand proudly along the main road . And yet , the taps run dry . The connections to the main line are not even functional . Young women still trudge the kilometers to the river , at risk to their own security , to collect water . Bright blue toilet stalls line the periphery of a girls school . While the school has seen an increase in attendance since the installation of these toilets , they continue to be plagued by their inability to deal with the sanitation requirements of their students . As we depart , the headmistress of the school pleads with us to help with the sanitation problem . <p> Some more recent data gathered from towns surrounding Lake Victoria in Uganda , Tanzania and Kenya , tell us a very different story than information from the MDG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us on the ground : while basic infrastructure ( water pipes , points , toilets ) may exist , those facilities are rarely functional , affordable or accessible , indicating to us that access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation services is substantially lower than many think . Presented with this information at a recent UN-Habitat meeting in Nairobi , international donors and development agencies were astonished . They asked , " how come we did n't know about this earlier ? " <p> And yet , unsurprisingly , the people of Kisii have long known that they do n't have appropriate water and sanitation services . They may not have even heard of the MDG 's . They are likely unaware of the conversations that transpire amongst donors and development agencies and help shape where resources are allocated . They are having their own conversations about what they need . But who can they tell ?

S. economic competitiveness and the policy and leadership needed to make this industry transformation a reality.Jon Wellinghoff , Commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) , surprised many in the audience by describing the 40 million electric vehicles on the road today in China ( many of which are scooters ) and emphatically argued that the grid is ready for plug-ins today . John Podesta , President of the Center for American Progress , credited Germanys feed-in tariff with creating a vibrant solar industry in Germany and causing the U. S. market share of the global solar industry to decline from 45% to 10% . Assistant Secretary of Energy Andy Karsnerannounced a $30 million Department of Energy investment in plug-in vehicle technology . Sue Tierney talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington at the state level and within the business community . Finally , Congressman Jay Inslee inspired the crowd by suggesting that we need visionary leadership on plug-in vehicles and renewable energy , likening the climate crisis to the challenge put forth by John F. Kennedy when he launched the Apollo program to put a man on the moon in 10 years . <h> Wednesday 6/11/2008 04:07:00 PM <p> Posted by Jenny Kwan , Climate and Energy Intern , Google.org <p> Hundreds of participants gathered today in Washington , DC as the Google.org - Brookings Institution conference kicked off . It was exciting to be able to see , in person , the latest electric car technology . <p> Outside the hotel we talked to Patrick from GM about their new Chevy Volt . If you look for it you can also spot the A123 car in the background . <p> Inside the conference room , I got to check out the latest Tesla . Unfortunately it 's a little out of my price range ... <p> I also met a bunch of people from around the US and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Felix Kramer with CalCars who was one of the first to bring electric vehicles to Washington DC many years ago : <p> And Seth from New York and Lars from Sweden were here to check out the crowd and learn about the latest news and technology : <h> 6/11/2008 03:50:00 PM <p> Posted by David Bercovich , Program Manager , Google.org <p> On another day of record-high gas prices , the Google.org/Brookings Institution conference on plug-in vehicles kicked off in Washington , DC today . Electrifying transportation impacts our economy , national security , and environment , and conference sessions overflowed with interested attendees . The lively afternoon session highlighted the broad coalition supporting plug-ins and demonstrated that the technology we need to electrify transportation is here today . <p> Jim Woolsey passionately argued that our dependence on oil is a national security emergency and that countries like Japan and Brazil have demonstrated the potential to overhaul an automotive fleet in a short period of time . Shai Agassi described Project Better Place and their plans to rapidly deploy electric vehicles in Israel . <p> Several speakers , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NRDC study on the impact of significant deployment of plug-in hybrids , including the finding that our current electric grid could power 73% of our vehicles if we charged them at night . Peter Darbee from PG&amp;E talked about how plug-in vehicles could work with smart electricity meters to increase the efficiency of the grid . <h> Tuesday 6/10/2008 08:17:00 PM <p> Posted by Michael Terrell , Program Manager , Google.org <p> A new survey commissioned by Google.org shows that three out of four voters support an active government role in promoting plug-in electric cars and trucks . The poll of more than 700 likely voters covered topics ranging from knowledge about plug-ins to opinions on how the government should promote them . <p> Plug-in electric vehicles run like regular hybrid cars , except they have larger batteries , recharge from a standard wall outlet , and can go more miles with less gas . Some plug-ins are purely electric and do n't  need gasoline at all . Given today 's record-high gas prices and concerns about energy security , plug-ins represent a promising solution for reducing oil dependence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Poll data showed a majority of voters said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supports federal efforts to bring plug-ins to the market , and more than 60 percent of voters are willing to spend more money to own a plug-in vehicle . <p> Over the next two days , Google.org and the Brookings Institution are hosting a conference in Washington , DC , " Plug-in Electric Vehicles 2008 : What Role for Washington ? " The conference will bring together Members of Congress , auto and utility executives , technologists , and plug-in advocates to spotlight plug-ins , examine their potential , and explore different federal policies to promote them .

If he were to tour our electrical grid , he would recognize that too . As former Secretary of State George Shultz says , in energy " the past must not be prologue . " Can we reinvent our energy system in only ten years ? I think we can -- but we need to have a clear mission , we need to aim high , and we need substantial and sustained R&amp;D funding . <p> This funding , coupled with tax incentives , loan guarantees , and other market mechanisms , is needed to drive innovation across the entire R&amp;D pipeline -- from research , to development , to demonstration , to deployment , to full-scale commercialization . At Google we like to say , " from lightbulbs to lightbulbs " -- from the initial idea to real products . However you phrase it , investment is needed across that entire pipeline , especially from the government in the early stages where the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate technological breakthroughs . <p> Since 1980 U.S. federal investment in energy R&amp;D has dropped by 58 percent . Back then , 10 percent of the total government R&amp;D investment was in energy . Today , the percentage has shrunk to only two percent . Recent signs in Washington are definitely positive . Earlier this year , President Obama added over $5.7 billion in 2-year stimulus funding for energy research , development , and demonstration . But this is n't enough , and it 's not sustained . We 're still on a 2-lane innovation road , not a superhighway -- and the road we 're currently on is headed for a big cliff . Unless something changes , we 're going to lose this significant funding after next year . <p> President Obama has called for $150 billion over 10 years for energy R&amp;D . Some experts go even further -- Professors Dan Kammen and Gregory Nemet at UC Berkeley propose that annual energy R&amp;D levels on the order of $30 billion will be necessary to address the climate challenge . And I was delighted to see recently that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund breakthrough ideas -- has made its first set of grants of $151 million for 37 projects . This is a great start , but it is only a start . We all need do our part to help convince our leaders in Washington to follow up on this down payment with substantial and sustained investment . <h> Tuesday 11/10/2009 09:46:00 AM <p> This year , it 's especially important to have clear information on what you can do to prepare for the flu season . With this in mind , we are happy to share a new feature for the U.S. which allows you to more easily find locations near you for getting both the seasonal and H1N1 flu vaccine . After expandingGoogle Flu Trends to a total of 20 countries and 38 languages , allowing more people to see near real-time estimates of flu activity , we began brainstorming with the U.S. Department for Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , their flu.gov collaborators and the American Lung Association on the flu shot finder and other ways Google can be helpful to people this flu season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ www.google.com/flushot . The same tool will also be available shortly on www.flu.gov and the American Lung Association websites . It 's important to note that this project is just beginning and we have not yet received information about flu shot clinics for many locations . In addition , many locations that are shown are currently out of stock . We launched this service now in order to help disseminate information about locations where vaccines are available , and also to make more vaccine providers aware of the project so that they can contribute . <p> Especially given slower than expected vaccine production , we think it 's important to bring together flu shot information in a coherent manner . We 've been working with HHS , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and state and local health agencies to gather information on flu vaccine locations across the country , particularly for the H1N1 flu vaccine ( both the nasal-spray vaccine and the shot ) . At the moment we have data for locations of flu vaccine directly from 20 states and counting . We are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all 50 states ; today , you 'll find results from chains such as Walgreens , CVS and PDX participants , such as Kmart , Duane Reade , WinnDixie and Giant Eagle . <p> Of course you should still call flu vaccine providers ahead of time to find out more about availability and eligibility for the two vaccines . <p> We hope to continue providing you with relevant information to help keep you and your loved ones healthy . 
@@13269029 @1869029/ <h> Monday 2/23/2009 04:17:00 PM <p> When Larry and Sergey laid out their vision for Google.org , they hoped that this " experiment in active philanthropy " would one day have an even greater impact on the world than Google itself . They committed resources from Google 's profits , equity and substantial employee time to this philanthropic effort , and they created the mission : " to use the power of information and technology to address the global challenges of our age . " They structured Google.org so that in addition to traditional grant making , it can also invest in for-profit companies , advocate for policies and , most important , tap into Google 's strengths : its employees , products and technologies . At first I was skeptical about " going corporate , " but I came on board convinced that Google could make real progress on these issues . I think we have made an excellent beginning , but it is just a very few steps on a long path . <p> Now , three years after Google.org was founded , we 've been reviewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's clear that I am most effective in helping to identify " big ideas " and potential partners , as well as raising awareness about society 's biggest challenges . I am therefore very excited to become Google 's Chief Philanthropy Evangelist . I think this is the highest contribution that I can make both to Google.org and to fighting the urgent threats of our day : from climate change to emerging infectious diseases , to issues of poverty and health care . By focusing my energy outwards I hope to be able to spend more time motivating policy makers , encouraging public and private partnerships , and generally advocating for the changes that we must make as a global society to solve these problems . Long-time Googler Megan Smith will take over day-to-day management of Google.org , joining as General Manager to lead us through this transition , in addition to her existing role as Vice President of New Business Development . <p> One of the first things that Megan will focus on is how Google.org can best achieve its mission . During our review it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable non-profit organizations over the past three years , our greatest impact has come when we 've attacked problems in ways that make the most of Google 's strengths in technology and information ; examples of this approach include Flu Trends , RechargeIT , Clean Energy 2030 , and PowerMeter . By aligning Google.org more closely with Google as a whole , Megan will ensure that we 're better able to build innovative , scalable technology and information solutions . As a first step , Google has decided to put even more engineers and technical talent to work on these issues and problems , resources which I have found to be extraordinary . In this global economic crisis , the work Google.org is doing , together with our many colleagues around the world , to help develop cheap clean energy , find and fight disease outbreaks before they sweep the globe , and build information platforms for underserved people globally , is more important than ever . We stand behind the commitment made in 2004 to devote 1% of Google 's equity and profits to philanthropy , and we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our resources have the greatest possible impact for good . <h> Wednesday 2/18/2009 11:24:00 PM <p> Just one week after launching Google 's energy information campaign , we kicked off our first joint smart grid event with GE , a larger clean energy collaboration we announced last fall . Our timing was fortuitous ; the event took place just as President Obama signed an historic economic stimulus bill that includes $11 billion to modernize the electricity grid . <p> Getting energy information into the hands of consumers requires reworking the electricity grid to make it smarter . At yesterday 's event , hosted in Google 's Washington office , experts explored what the fundamental elements of a smarter grid should be -- from empowering consumers with information , tools , and choices to manage their energy use , to creating an open system that encourages innovation , to enabling a massive scale up of renewable energy sources and plug-in vehicles . We also explored the government 's role in accelerating these efforts . Our panelists were enthusiastic about the opportunity created by the stimulus , but also noted the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effective and efficient manner . <p> Historically such funding has been anemic . After a peak in 1978 of $7 billion , U.S. government funding for energy RD&amp;D dropped by more than 70% . Corporate RD&amp;D fell even more , and funding in the early 2000s totaled just 0.3% of sector revenue , compared to 15% in the biotech sector . Is it any wonder the energy sector has struggled to make progress ? <p> What level of energy RD&amp;D funding is needed ? Kammen and Nemet look at several different metrics and suggest that a sustained level between $20-40 billion is needed to reinvigorate the field . Recent activities push in the right direction : 2008 funding reached $3 billion , 50% higher than during the early 2000s , and the stimulus bill recently signed into law adds $3.25 billion in new RD&amp;D funding for clean energy . But to have a truly transformative effect , investment needs to climb even higher . <p> In addition , without emphasizing the " R " in RD&amp;D , we will produce only incremental improvements . We need to prime the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce radically better ( and cheaper ) technologies . This will provide long-term job growth , and also increase consumers ' buying power , stimulating the economy . <p> Funding must also be coupled with long-term demand for clean technology . This gives companies confidence their investments will pay out , and assures students entering the field that jobs wo n't evaporate . Research must also focus more on clean tech ; in recent years only 40% of energy RD&amp;D funding has gone to renewable energy and energy efficiency . <p> At Google we 've learned some that might be successfully applied to energy : <p> " Put the user first and all else follows . " For instance , customers care about saving money , but only if it 's easy to measure . Providing ways to cheaply monitor energy consumption is a powerful first step . <p> " Great just is n't good enough . " Cost-parity for renewables is required for long-term competitiveness , but to replace conventional technology we must develop renewable electricity cheaper than coal , the least expensive fossil fuel . <p> " Launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get new technologies into the marketplace quickly , then improve through iteration . <p> These strategies will make sure that the widest possible set of ideas are considered , increasing the number of breakthroughs . A " fail fast " policy would allocate people to the great ideas , with high-impact results guaranteeing continued funding , particularly at the critical demonstration stage where many technologies fail to attract sufficient capital . Carrying projects over this " Valley of Death " to full commercialization will ultimately result in the best , lowest-cost technologies rapidly reaching the market . For the sake of the planet , clean energy ca n't arrive soon enough . <h> Thursday 2/12/2009 01:06:00 PM <p> A guest post from Howard White , Executive Director , International Initiative for Impact Evaluation : <p> In the foreign aid business , it 's very important to answer the question , " Was this a successful project ? " because donors need to know where to target their scarce resources . Unfortunately , the answer to this question has frequently been , " Well it must be , we spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This problem has been most recently highlighted by the Centre for Global Developments report , " When Will We Ever Learn ? " . Billions of dollars are spent on development interventions each year with little evidence on whether they work or not . <p> I started my own academic career looking at aid impact at the macroeconomic level . In my own defense , I can say that , starting with my PhD , I criticized the over-aggregated cross-country regression approach , arguing instead for careful country-level analysis of macro impact that could pick up on both context but also the many channels both money and ideas through which aid affects development outcomes . Having published a couple of widely ignored books pursuing this approach , I became increasingly convinced that aid impact had to be examined from the bottom up . That is a systematic analysis of , if not all interventions , then enough to be able to make authoritative statements about whether the aid program is working or not . This might seem like a lot of work ; but then so is measuring GDP and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to implementing a bottom up approach . The first is that evaluation design is often poor when it comes to measuring impact . The second problem is that most agencies do not systematically compile evidence across interventions . It is symptomatic of a culture of producing evaluations as a bureaucratic requirement , not as a management or learning tool . <p> It is to tackle these two problems - the lack of evidence and the failure to synthesize what evidence there is into policy-relevant lessons that the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation ( 3ie ) has been created . Google.org has been one of our early funders . <p> The bulk of 3ie funding is going to help expand our knowledge about what works by supporting new impact studies , focusing on what we call the enduring questions of development . We are in the process of a consultative exercise to identify these questions to which you can contribute by visiting our website . We will also have an open window for studies on other topics , for which the first request for proposals went out recently . Please visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2/09/2009 09:07:00 PM <p> Imagine how hard it would be to stick to a budget in a store with no prices . Well , that 's pretty much how we buy electricity today . Your utility company sends you a bill at the end of the month with very few details . Most people do n't know how much electricity their appliances use , where in the house they are wasting electricity , or how much the bill might go up during different seasons . But in a world where everyone had a detailed understanding of their home energy use , we could find all sorts of ways to save energy and lower electricity bills . In fact , studies show that access to home energy information results in savings between 5-15% on monthly electricity bills . It may not sound like much , but if half of America 's households cut their energy demand by 10 percent , it would be the equivalent of taking eight million cars off the road . <p> Googles mission is to " organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed information about their home electricity use . We 're tackling the challenge on several fronts , from policy advocacy to developing consumer tools , and even investing in smart grid companies . We 've been participating in the dialogue in Washington , DC and with public agencies in the U.S. and other parts of the world to advocate for investment in the building of a " smart grid , " to bring our 1950s-era electricity grid into the digital age . Specifically , to provide both consumers and utilities with real-time energy information , homes must be equipped with advanced energy meters called " smart meters . " There are currently about 40 million smart meters in use worldwide , with plans to add another 100 million in the next few years . <p> But deploying smart meters alone is n't enough . This needs to be coupled with a strategy to provide customers with easy access to energy information . That 's why we believe that open protocols and standards should serve as the cornerstone of smart grid projects , to spur innovation , drive competition , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We believe that detailed data on your personal energy use belongs to you , and should be available in an open standard , non-proprietary format . You should control who gets to see your data , and you should be free to choose from a wide range of services to help you understand it and benefit from it . For more details on our policy suggestions , check out the comments we filed yesterday with the California Public Utility Commission . <p> In addition to policy advocacy , we 're building consumer tools , too . Over the last several months , our engineers have developed a software tool called Google PowerMeter , which will show consumers their home energy information almost in real time , right on their computer . Google PowerMeter is not yet available to the public since we 're testing it out with Googlers first . But we 're building partnerships with utilities and independent device manufacturers to gradually roll this out in pilot programs . Once we 've had a chance to kick the tires , we 'll make the tool more widely available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with detailed energy information . And it will take the combined efforts of federal and state governments , utilities , device manufacturers , and software engineers to empower consumers to use electricity more wisely by giving them access to energy information .

It will build on a current U.S. National Academies study , which is assessing the technology risks and tradeoffs for various energy technologies . An understanding of the geographic , technical , and economic constraints will help guide Chinese decision makers to develop appropriate strategies to sustainably meet their energy needs . Chinas manufacturing prowess , combined with its growing domestic market , provide opportunities to accelerate progress and reduce costs for renewable energy technologies . <p> The U.S. and China represent the world 's two largest consumers of energy .

What about the poor and developing countries where people are offline more than online ? How do they benefit from the power of information ? <p> In much of Sub-Saharan Africa , for example , rates of economic growth over the last decade have exceeded 5% every year . Despite this trend , poverty in many countries has remained constant . In Kenya , for example , the official poverty rate was 48% in 1981 . According to the Kenya Poverty and Inequality Assessment released by the World Bank this year , 17 million Kenyans or 47% of the population were unable to meet the costs of food sufficient to fulfill basic daily caloric requirements .

Data on water quality , education and health budgets , and agricultural prices are nearly impossible to access . <p> Despite hundreds of millions of dollars spent each year on providing basic public services like primary education , health , water , and sanitation to poor communities , poverty in much of Sub-Saharan Africa persists . Where does this money go , who gets it , and what are the results of the resources invested ? That 's where we find a big black hole of information and a lack of basic accountability . How do inputs ( dollars spent ) turn into outputs ( schools , clinics , and wells ) , and , more importantly , how do outputs translate into results ( literate and healthy children , clean water , etc . ) ? <p> We simply do n't  know the answers to most of these basic questions . But what if we could ? What if a mother could find out how much money was budgeted for her daughter 's school each year and how much of it was received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often teachers are absent from school or whether health clinics have the medicines they are supposed to carry ? What if citizens could access and report on basic information to determine value for money as tax payers ? <p> The work of SODNET in Kenya is illustrative . They are developing a simple budget-tracking tool that allows citizens to track the allocation , use , and ultimate result of government funds earmarked for infrastructure projects in their districts . The tool is intended to create transparency in the use of tax revenues and answer the simple question : Are resources reaching their intended beneficiaries ? Using tools like maps , they are able to overlay information that begins to tell a compelling story . <p> Google.orgs role , through our partners in East Africa and India , is to support , catalyze , and widely disseminate this kind of information to public , private , and civil society stakeholders that can use it to see more clearly what 's working , what 's broken and what are potential solutions . Leveraging platforms like Google Earth and Google Maps can help organizations disseminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was once invisible . Once information is visible , widely known , and easy to understand , we are betting that governments and citizens will pay more attention to leakages in the service delivery pipeline and feel empowered to propose solutions . <p> You ca n't change what you cant see . The power to know plus the power to act on what you know is the surest way to achieve positive social change from the bottom up . And when we consider the magnitude of resources invested in delivering public services each year , a 10% improvement globally would exceed the value of all foreign aid . We believe that is a bet worth making . <h> Friday 10/10/2008 11:58:00 AM <p> This week the Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) released a report , The Deadly Dozen : Wildlife Diseases in the Age of Climate Change , which lists 12 pathogens ( including Avian Influenza , Cholera , Ebola , Lyme Disease , and Yellow fever ) that are expected to spread as a result of continued climate change . WCS highlights that the spread of this deadly dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cascading effects on the global economy . But , the report does not leave us in the dead zone . It points to how monitoring wildlife and the ecosystems in which they live can help us to manage these emergent human health threats . <p> This report , which draws from a new book , is just one of a series of new interdisciplinary studies ( others can be found here , here , and here ) that call for more proactive and holistic ( " One Health " ) approaches to management of emerging infectious diseases . " One Health " integrates human , animal and ecosystem health . <p> We are beginning to see public health training and disease management programs integrate animal health ( often with a focus on livestock ) into their plans . However , much less action has been taken to integrate ecosystem factors into disease management . This is not surprising given that integrating animal health into the human public health systems , although a large step institutionally , is a relatively small step conceptually . Many of the same tools and methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as surveillance , vaccination , and laboratory diagnostics . <p> In contrasts , linking ecosystem health including wildlife and wildlands-- and the risks of regional and global environmental change with the public health system requires a large conceptual leap . Traditionally , " environmental health " focuses on managing the health implications of pollution , toxics and occupational health . However , the environmental changes we are experiencing today , such as climate change , deforestation and biodiversity loss are fundamentally different types of problems . They entail disruptive systemic changes in underlying function of the systems . Managing the health implications of these systematic changes such as WCSs Deadly Dozen will require the conceptual leap of transforming our public health infrastructure to a one health infrastructure . <h> Thursday 10/09/2008 05:22:00 PM <p> When I arrived in Dar es Salaam , I was greeted with a warm smile and a " Karibu sana " -- " You are welcomed " in Swahili -- that set the tone for my visit to Tanzania . <p> I attended the Annual General &amp; Scientific Meeting of the INDEPTH Network . INDEPTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting data on nearly every aspect of the lives of a surveyed population -- on infectious disease , cause of deaths , migration , health service utilization , livelihood , reproductive health , and more -- across 37 sites in 19 countries in Africa , Asia , Central America and Oceania . For one of the surveillance site in Matlab , a rural area about 70 kilometres southeast of Dhaka the capital of Bangladesh , data collection has been taking place for over 40 years now . Data has been used to evaluate disease patterns and trends and also to test health interventions . In total , 2.2 million people every year are being monitored -- this provides required health and demographic data that enable developing countries to set evidence-based health priorities and policies . <p> Not surprisingly , data sharing within and across field sites and countries presents significant challenges to data management due to uncertainty in data access , poor metadata , and disparate data quality standards . Some of these issues and challenges were discussed during a session on technological innovations . Of particular interest was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis within and across sites in Burkina Faso , India , Papua New Guinea , Tanzania , and Thailand . We also learned about projects in Uganda and Bangladesh piloting the use of mobile survey software for data collection one of the sites was collecting 29,000 forms a year . Another point that piqued my interest was the concept of a " Health System Observatory " operating at different levels that would foster research discovery , innovation , and interactions between researchers , policy-makers , and other communities . <p> A concrete next step for me is to explore the possibility of leveraging INDEPTH capabilities to investigate the impact of ecology , climate , and socioeconomic change on the transmission of infectious diseases for more targeted control activities at local level . <h> Wednesday 10/01/2008 10:33:00 AM <p> Right now the U.S. has a very real opportunity to transform our economy from one running on fossil fuels to one largely based on clean energy . We are developing the technologies and know-how to accomplish this . We can build whole new industries and create millions of new jobs . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at home . We can improve our national security . And we can put a big dent in climate change . With strong leadership we could be moving forward on an aggressive but realistic timeline and an approach that balances costs with real economic gains . <p> The energy team at Google has been crunching the numbers to see how we could greatly reduce fossil fuel use by 2030 . Our analysis , led by Jeffery Greenblatt , suggests a potential path to weaning the U.S. off of coal and oil for electricity generation by 2030 ( with some remaining use of natural gas as well as nuclear ) , and cutting oil use for cars by 40% . Al Gore has issued a challenge that is even more ambitious , getting us to carbon-free electricity even sooner . We hope the American public pushes our leaders to embrace it . T. Boone Pickens has weighed in with an interesting plan of his own to massively deploy wind energy , among other things . Other plans have also been developed in recent years that merit attention . <p> Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2030 proposal is to stimulate debate and we invite you to take a look and comment - or offer an alternative approach if you disagree . With a new Administration and Congress - and multiple energy-related imperatives - this is an opportune , perhaps unprecedented , moment to move from plan to action . <p> Over 22 years this plan could generate billions of dollars in savings and help create millions of green jobs . Many of these high quality , good-paying jobs will be in today 's coal and oil producing states . <p> To get there we need immediate action on three fronts : <p> ( 1 ) Reduce demand by doing more with less <p> We should start with the low-hanging fruit by reducing energy demand through energy efficiency -- adopting technologies and practices that allow us to do more with less . At Google , we 've seen the benefits of this approach . We identified $5M in building efficiency investments with a 2.5 year payback . We 've also designed our own data centers to run more efficiently , and we believe they are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , personal computers can also become much more efficient . A typical desktop PC wastes nearly half the power it consumes . Last year , Bill Weihl , our Green Energy Czar , worked with industry partners to create the Climate Savers Computing Initiative to raise energy efficiency standards for personal computers and servers . If we meet our goals , these standards will cut energy consumption by the equivalent of 10-20 coal-fired power plants by 2010 . <p> Government can have a big impact on achieving greater efficiency . California 's aggressive building codes , efficiency standards and utility programs have helped the state keep per-capita energy use flat for years , while consumption in much of the rest of the country has grown significantly . Enacting similar policies at the national level would help even more . <p> We also need to give the American people opportunities to be more efficient . The way we buy electricity today is like going to a store without seeing prices : we pick what we want , and receive an unintelligible bill at the end of the month . When homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that energy use typically drops . Google is looking at ways that we can use our information technology and our reach to help increase awareness and bring better , real-time information to consumers . <p> ( 2 ) Develop renewable energy that is cheaper than coal ( RE&lt;C ) <p> Googles data centers draw from a U.S. electricity grid that relies on coal for 50% of its power . We want to help catalyze the development of renewable energy that is price competitive with coal . At least three technologies show tremendous promise : wind , solar thermal , and advanced geothermal . Each of these is abundant and , when combined , could supply energy in virtually every region of the U.S. <p> This year Google has invested over $45 million in startup companies with breakthrough wind , solar and geothermal technologies through our Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal ( RE&lt;C ) initiative , but that is a drop when we need a flood . We need to unleash massive private investment in clean energy . The government can have a big impact here as well . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid deployment and scaling of clean technologies such as long-term tax support and a national renewable energy standard . Tax credits for wind and solar have lapsed several times in the last 20 years , starving these nascent industries of the capital they need to truly enter the mainstream . <p> We also must work both sides of the RE&lt;C equation . Progress will be accelerated when the price of carbon reflects its true costs to society . Putting a price on carbon through cap-and-trade or a carbon tax would help address this . <p> ( 3 ) Electrify transportation and re-invent our electric grid <p> Imagine driving a car that uses no gas and is less expensive to recharge than buying a latte . A " smart grid " allows you to charge when electricity is cheap , and maybe even make some money by selling unused power back to the grid when it 's needed . Plug-in cars are on their way , with GM , Toyota and other manufacturers planning introductions in the next two years . At Google we have a small fleet of Toyota Prius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our RechargeIT program . The converted Prius plug-ins get over 90 MPG , and the Escapes close to 50 MPG . However to successfully put millions of plug-in cars on the road and and fuel them with green electricity , we need a smart grid that manages when we charge and how we 're billed . A smart grid could also provide for the two-way flow of electricity , as well as large-scale integration of intermittent solar and wind energy . Much of the technology in our current electrical grid was developed in the 60s and is wasteful and not very smart . We are partnering with GE to help accelerate the development of the smart grid and support building new transmission lines to harness our nation 's vast renewable energy resources . <p> We see a huge opportunity for the nation to confront our energy challenges . In the process we will stimulate investment , create jobs , empower consumers and , by the way , help address climate change .

Based on this finding , we launched Google Flu Trends to provide timely estimates of flu activity in 28 countries . Since then , we 've seen a number of other researchersincluding our very ownuse search activity data to estimate other real world activities . <p> However , tools that provide access to search data , such as Google Trends or Google Insights for Search , werent designed with this type of research in mind . Those systems allow you to enter a search term and see the trend ; but researchers told us they want to enter the trend of some real world activity and see which search terms best match that trend .

Using Correlate , you can upload your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity best corresponds with that real world trend . In the example below , we uploaded official flu activity data from the U.S. CDC over the last several years and found that people search for terms like cold or flu in a similar pattern to actual flu rates .

What 's interesting is that the ups and downs of web search activity for cell biology terms is unique enough that searching on Correlate for ribosome brings up searches for other biology terms , such as mitochondria .

@@13269035 @1869035/ <h> Wednesday 5/20/2009 12:01:00 AM <p> Earlier this year I blogged about energy information and a tool our engineers developed called Google PowerMeter , a Google gadget that can show consumers their personal electricity consumption right on a home computer . Our software relies on " smart meters " ( or other metering devices ) as a data source . Over the past several months we 've been looking to partner with utilities that are installing ( or have already installed ) this equipment in their customers ' homes . We 're energized by our very first Google PowerMeter partners : <p> Our initial partners include utilities with millions of customers as well as smaller ones . They are rural and urban , privately held and municipally run . Some are in the United States , others in Canada and India . They all have one thing in common a desire to serve their customers by providing access to detailed information that helps save energy and money . For now , Google PowerMeter is only available to a limited group of customers , but we plan to expand our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading the charge to make the electricity grid smarter and we look forward to working with them and others . <p> In addition to utilities , we 're also seeking partnerships with companies that can enable the implementation of our software . Our first such partner is Itron , a leading meter and data management company that serves over 8,000 utilities and is helping some of their customers , including San Diego Gas &amp; Electric , integrate with Google PowerMeter . If you 're a utility or company with a smart meter project that might be interested in plugging in to our efforts , visit our website for more information . <h> 5/13/2009 03:00:00 PM <p> As we blogged last summer , there are lots of experiments running on Google web search all over the world . Today we 've started a temporary experiment that some people might find interesting : we 're researching how Google users search the Internet when they or someone they know is feeling sick . <p> Understanding how people search when they 're feeling sick is an important problem to solve , as it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregated search data to detect influenza epidemics . Statistics gathered in this experiment may also help Google deliver more relevant search results in the future . For example , someone who searches for arthritis pain to understand why an aging parent is experiencing joint pain might want to learn about nearby health facilities and potential treatments , whereas somebody who searches for arthritis pain because she is doing a research project might want results about how common arthritis is and what its risk factors are . Rather than make educated guesses about how many users are searching because they 're sick , we 're running this experiment to collect real statistics . This is not a permanent change , but a short-term experiment . A small percentage of random health-related searches will trigger the poll question . <p> For example , at the bottom of the search results for headache , some users will see a survey which asks whether they were searching because they or someone they know has a headache : <p> Similarly , if you happen to search for ibuprofen , a common anti-inflammatory drug , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you or somebody you know is taking ibuprofen : <p> Data collected in this survey will be aggregated across thousands of users .

We also asked the DOE to ensure the program contributes to President Obama 's goal of funding the installation of 40 million smart electricity meters in American homes . You can read our comments here . <p> The advent of smart meters , the Internet and a myriad of other information technologies means that our interaction with electricity can be dramatically redefined .

Most importantly , these investments can help consumers and businesses save energy and money . We feel it 's important for the country not to miss this opportunity .

Will East Africans become net consumers or producers of information ? <p> Last week , Kenya held its first " content " conference arranged by the national ICT Board . Public and private people had plenty to say about " local content " and why it mattered . What started as a technical discussion about connectivity quickly turned to issues of national pride , language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultures . While Kenyans clearly yearn to be part of the global community and consume information far beyond their borders , they also want to be heard , recognized , and contribute to global conversations . They want their news , their music , their issues , and their voices to find a place in the online universe . <p> Today , Swahili books online for example , number in the hundreds compared to the hundreds of millions of books in English available online . What message does this send to young people about the relative importance of their knowledge , language , and culture ? Fortunately , Google translation tools are beginning to address this challenge and launching search in Swahili is creating the right incentives to put more content online . But what else will it take to create symmetry between the number of people who speak a given language and content available to them ? <p> The good news is that there is no paucity of African content in the offline world . Africa is home to some of the worlds richest musical traditions , oral histories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news is that mobile phones are likely to be gateways to the internet in much of the continent . The challenge is how to migrate this wealth of content from the offline to the online world . If Africans are going to get online en masse , they need a reason to go there and they need to see themselves , their values , and their stories when looking through the online prism . With the availability of Google MapMaker in Africa , were already seeing that people are creating their own content and populating base maps with layers that are meaningful and useful to them . That is exciting . Whether its stories , pictures , or data on budgets and literacy rates , I hope we can give people a stake and a reason to get online and participate in the information society . <h> Thursday 11/20/2008 01:27:00 PM <p> With a new President and Congress , we have an unprecedented opportunity to transform our fossil fuel economy to one based largely on clean energy , while creating millions of jobs in the process . <p> Last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. can dramatically scale up renewable energy , become smarter about how we use energy , and deploy millions of plug-in electric cars . Our energy team has continued crunching the numbers and just posted new data on job creation and cost savings on our knol . We 'll keep updating the information and encourage everyone to take a look and comment - and offer alternative approaches if you disagree . <p> Reaching the goals of Clean Energy 2030 will require a comprehensive effort by the new President and Congress . At a minimum , we believe it should include putting a price on carbon emissions , setting national energy efficiency and renewable energy goals , and modernizing our electricity grid . With the right policies , we can drive trillions of dollars of new investment in clean energy and create millions of new jobs . <p> Stimulating the economy and creating jobs will be the first item of business when the new President and Congress take office in January . We hope that clean energy will be front and center . In its last effort to address the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy , but much more needs to be done . Here are some ideas on how to advance clean energy as part of a stimulus package : <p> Get money flowing to renewable energy . Many wind and solar project developers cant take advantage of the renewable tax credits that were just extended . The continuing economic decline has wiped out profits in many companies - and the otherwise expected tax liability that credits offset . Congress should make changes , such as making the credits refundable , to make it possible for investors to get the value Congress intended . <p> Start building a smarter electricity grid . The last large energy bill passed in 2007 authorized , but did not fund , matching grants and demonstration programs to encourage investment in a " smart " electricity grid . These programs should be fully funded and expanded so more consumers have the opportunity to better monitor and control their electricity use and reduce their bills . A new Department of Energy ( DOE ) sponsored book explaining smart grid describes it as " the internet brought to our electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient . The DOE has a Weatherization Assistance Program that enables low-income families to permanently reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient . On average , weatherization reduces households ' heating bills by about 30% . President-elect Obama adopted our proposal to weatherize one million low income homes per year for the next 10 years . Current federal weatherization funding supports barely 10% of that number . A roughly $3 billion appropriation would weatherize roughly one million homes . <p> Green the Government . The U.S. government is the largest consumer of electricity . Accordingly , federal departments and agencies should lead by example when it comes to stimulating the economy through expanded energy efficiency efforts and increased use of clean energy . In addition , the Congress and the President can provide support to State and local governments for efficiency and smart grid projects ; the purchase of renewable power ; and converting vehicle fleets to low-emission vehicles , particularly plug-in electric cars and trucks . Such concerted government action will speed the advent of a new era of energy security and domestic job creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improve energy security . If you have ideas to share , join the discussion on the Clean Energy 2030 knol . <h> Wednesday 11/19/2008 10:46:00 AM <p> Early readers of the Google.org blog may recall us embarking on a film project portraying public health heroes working in the field to eradicate polio . Gone from the modern world , new cases of polio continue to afflict mostly children under age 3 in the poorest regions of just a few countries India , Nigeria , Afghanistan and Pakistan . When we first announced this project and the collaboration between Google.org and Vermilion Films , filming was underway primarily in India and Afghanistan , documenting the front lines of public health in some forgotten corners of our world . <p> David Heymann of the World Health Organization reminds us , " When you have n't seen a disease for quite a while , which is the case in the industrialized countries , you forget about the terrible disease that it really is .

Whether you 're interested in U.S. elections , today 's hot trends , or each year 's Zeitgeist , patterns in Google search queries can be very informative . Last year , a small team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond simple trends and accurately model real-world phenomena using patterns in search queries . After meeting with the public health gurus on Google.org 's Predict and Prevent team , we decided to focus on outbreaks of infectious disease , which are responsible for millions of deaths around the world each year . You 've probably heard of one such disease : influenza , commonly known as " the flu , " which is responsible for up to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year . If you or your kids have ever caught the flu , you know just how awful it can be . <p> Our team found that certain aggregated search queries tend to be very common during flu season each year . We compared these aggregated queries against data provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , and we found that there 's a very close relationship between the frequency of these search queries and the number of people who are experiencing flu-like symptoms each week . As a result , if we tally each day 's flu-related search queries , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this discovery , we have launched Google Flu Trends , where you can find up-to-date influenza-related activity estimates for each of the 50 states in the U.S. <p> The CDC does a great job of surveying real doctors and patients to accurately track the flu , so why bother with estimates from aggregated search queries ? It turns out that traditional flu surveillance systems take 1-2 weeks to collect and release surveillance data , but Google search queries can be automatically counted very quickly . By making our flu estimates available each day , Google Flu Trends may provide an early-warning system for outbreaks of influenza . <p> For epidemiologists , this is an exciting development , because early detection of a disease outbreak can reduce the number of people affected . If a new strain of influenza virus emerges under certain conditions , a pandemic could emerge and cause millions of deaths ( as happened , for example , in 1918 ) . Our up-to-date influenza estimates may enable public health officials and health professionals to better respond to seasonal epidemics and though we hope never to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Epidemiology and Prevention Branch of the Influenza Division at CDC throughout the 2007-2008 flu season , and together we saw that our search-based flu estimates had a consistently strong correlation with real CDC surveillance data . Our system is still very experimental , so anything is possible , but we 're hoping to see similar correlations in the coming year . <p> We could n't have created such good models without aggregating hundreds of billions of individual searches going back to 2003 . Of course , we 're keenly aware of the trust that users place in us and of our responsibility to protect their privacy . Flu Trends can never be used to identify individual users because we rely on anonymized , aggregated counts of how often certain search queries occur each week . The patterns we observe in the data are only meaningful across large populations of Google search users . <p> Flu season is here , so avoid becoming part of our statistics and get a flu shot ! And keep an eye on those graphs if you 're curious to see how the flu season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published an academic paper in Nature , the international journal of science , explaining the science and methodology behind Flu Trends . Check it out for more information . <h> 11/04/2008 11:07:00 AM <p> On September 12 2008 , Cecilia van Deventer , a safari booking agent living in Zambia , was flown to South Africa in critical condition . She died just two days later . By October 6 2008 , three more people had died : the paramedic who accompanied Cecilia to South Africa , the nurse who cared for her in Intensive Care , and the cleaner who cleaned her hospital room after her death . A fifth patient , a nurse who cared for the infected paramedic , is receiving anti-viral treatment . In all cases , people infected were exposed to infected blood and/or body fluids . <p> South Africa 's National Institute for Communicable Diseases ( NICD ) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( US-CDC ) quickly identified the infectious agent as an arenavirus similar to the one that causes Lassa Fever - a disease that affects 500 000 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequencing of the viral genome by Professor Ian Lipkin and colleagues at the Center for Infection and Immunity ( CII ) at Columbia University , it has been clearly shown that this is an arenavirus that has never been seen before . Google.org 's Predict and Prevent initiative recently announced a grant of $2.5 million to support CII 's work in pathogen discovery . This identification of a novel arenavirus not only represents an early success , but also demonstrates just why this work is so important . ' There is no doubt we are dealing with a newly emerged virus , ' said Dr. Janusz Paweska , head of the special pathology unit at the NICD in Johannesburg . As Professor Robert Swanepoel , also of the NICD , has pointed out , the virus is ' newly-discovered ' rather than new , and has probably been around in animal populations for some time before making a recent jump to humans . <p> Arenaviruses , normally transferred to humans through contact with the urine of their rodent hosts , can be classified into New and Old World viruses depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectively . New World arenaviruses , including Junin , Machupo , Sabia and Guanarito , can cause viral hemorrhagic fever . This particular virus , classified as Old World due to its African origins , began as a flu-like illness , then caused diarrhea , pharyngitis and a rash before rapidly culminating in respiratory distress , neurological symptoms and circulatory collapse over a period of about 9-12 days . The virus has yet to receive a name . <p> Due to the swift action of the NICD , US-CDC and CII the outbreak is now described as contained . We commend their efforts !

The software receives information from utility smart meters and in-home energy management devices and visualizes this information on a personalized iGoogle homepage . Today we 're announcing both our very first UK utility partnership and our very first UK device partner . <p> Our utility partner , first:utility , is the only energy supplier in the United Kingdom to provide free smart meters to its customers , and is currently in the process of rolling them out across the country . To date , first:utility has over 30,000 customers signed up to its service . Starting in early November , all first:utility customers with smart meters will be able to sign up to use Google PowerMeter , empowering them with greater information about their home electricity use . According to Mark Daeche , first:utilitys Chief Executive , " At the end of the day , if you ca n't measure and view your energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Google is also partnering with AlertMe , a self-install consumer device manufacturer and our first partner with a product available in the United Kingdom .

Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company will receive $130 million to provide 771,000 meters to 100% of its customers . These technologies will enable consumers to receive direct feedback on their energy use , which can lead to energy savings of up to 15% on average . Altogether the awards will fund the installation of 18 million smart meters , 1 million in-home energy displays and 170,000 smart thermostats . <p> With the advent of smart meters and other information technologies , we have the opportunity to rebuild the electricity grid , which still uses century-old technology in places . Most importantly , we can make the grid work better for consumers . Today 's announcement is an ambitious step toward that goal . <h> Monday 10/26/2009 09:11:00 AM <p> The first outbreak of the new " swine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year in Mexico caught the world by surprise .

This exploration often brings us into dialogue with many start-up social enterprises and other philanthropies trying to overcome challenges working directly with less advantaged populations . One such group , LGT Venture Philanthropy , has articulated a recurring theme : organizations with effective and innovative solutions to social and environmental problems often lack the manpower and expertise to implement these solutions in the most effective way , especially during the growth phase . They have come up with a creative solution : the iCats Program . <p> The iCats Program was designed to bridge the gap between philanthropic organizations or social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business professionals with the desire to apply their knowledge and experience to benefit the social sector , thus acting as " impact catalysts .

To help you out , we at Google.org are excited to announce the expansion of Google Flu Trends to 16 additional countries , including much of Europe . We 've also made the site available in 37 languages . Flu is a global threat , affecting millions worldwide each year , so we 're pleased to make this tool available in more regions and languages . <p> Last November , we launched Google Flu Trends in the United States after finding a close relationship between how many people search for flu-related topics and how many people actually have flu symptoms . By tracking the popularity of certain Google search queries , we are able to estimate the level of flu , in near real-time . While some traditional flu surveillance systems may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google search queries can be counted immediately . Google Flu Trends provides an additional surveillance tool that may help public health officials and the public make more informed decisions about preparing for the flu season . <p> In the past year , we 've expanded our coverage to include Mexico , New Zealand and Australia and have continued to see a good correspondence between our estimates and official flu activity data . In fact , our analysis of last season shows that Google Flu Trends had a close 0.92 correlation with official U.S. flu data . <p> An important aspect of Google Flu Trends is that we filter out terms that may be popular because people hear about them in the news . What we do not use in the models is a term like swine flu since people are more likely to type that into Google because they want to know more information about it , given the news headlines , and not because they actually have H1N1 or swine flu .

This means that utilities can enable self-serve sign-up for customers to use the Google PowerMeter gadget . More users means improved feedback on our product and this will translate into an improved product experience . Here 's how it works : If your utility has open enrollment enabled for your account , with just two simple steps you can have your usage data transmitted to Google and visible online via Google PowerMeter . <p> Yello Strom , a German utility and our first partner in Europe , is fully up and running with open enrollment .

As Executive Director Martin Vesper put it , " We are now offering our customers even more ways to maintain an overview of their electricity consumption with the help of the internet . And when people know exactly what is going on with their energy usage , they can use energy efficiently without sacrificing convenience . " <p> Other Google PowerMeter partners are also working towards open enrollment capabilities . Florida 's JEA has built an open enrollment system and is actively rolling it out within their customer base .

( That means having a smart meter installed by your utility is no longer a prerequisite for using Google PowerMeter ! ) For the last several months , a few hundred Google employees have been testing a number of in-home electricity monitoring devices . Those of us lucky enough to have one of these devices installed in our homes experienced first-hand how access to high-resolution energy use information drives meaningful behavior change . So we set out to make that data easier for everyone to access and understand by sending the collected data to our Google PowerMeter software . <p> Combined with Google PowerMeter , the TED 5000 device can help you understand your electricity usage to save energy and money .

@@13269042 @1869042/ <p> Each year we review our Google Flu Trends models and may update them , if an update would make them more accurate when compared with the official influenza data we benchmark against .

Though generally getting the trend correct , the original model underestimated the magnitude of ILI activity during the H1N1 . Why was this the case ? In short , search behavior changed during H1N1 . This was especially true for the categories " influenza complications " and " term for influenza . " This is not unexpected , since differing complications and the fact that H1N1 began spreading during the northern hemisphere summer rather than winter likely played a role .

The cost of bringing in the goats is comparable to hiring lawn mowers for the same job and the green benefits are clear : the goats eliminate mower emissions , reduce noise pollution , restore plant species and fertilize while grazing . <p> Do n't  worry , were not going to be in the business of ch+vre anytime soon , but in the meantime were having a lot of fun watching our new colleagues . <h> 4/15/2010 09:55:00 AM <p> Yesterday , when a powerful earthquake struck the Qinghai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobilized to see how we could help with disaster response . <p> We are working on several tools to help people on the ground find out more information about the earthquake , connect with loved ones , as well as help with recovery efforts . <p> For those concerned about loved ones in Qinghai , the China Person Finder tool can be used to submit or search for information about individuals who may have been affected . The tool is available in Simplified Chinese , Traditional Chinese and English . We encourage organizations and media sites to embed the gadget on their sites and help spread the word . <p> In addition , users can access earthquake information on Google News and Google Maps from a link on our homepages on google.com.hk , and google.com.tw .

What if we instead had access to more useful and actionable information about our energy consumption ? What if consumers could use this information to automatically adjust appliances , lights , and other equipment to save money and cut energy use ? <p> That 's what a group of over 45 major companies and organizations said today in a letter to President Obama . Signers include companies like AT&amp;T , General Electric and Intel and NGOs like The Climate Group , NRDC and the Alliance to Save Energy . The group also includes start ups , smart grid companies , venture firms and trade organizations . <p> This diverse group shares a common vision : giving consumers the ability to monitor and manage their power use will save them energy and money . It will also unleash innovation in homes and businesses as new energy saving technologies and apps are developed . <p> This group will continue to look for ways to offer ideas to policymakers on how to empower consumers with energy saving tools and information .

If you can make it , RSVP here . <h> Friday 4/02/2010 12:22:00 PM <p> The international community likes to define Liberias recent history primarily through two events : its fourteen-year civil war , which ended in 2003 , and the work of the countrys president , Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , the first democratically elected female leader in Africa . The chart below illustrates both . On my recent trip to Liberia , first with a group of Bay Area philanthropists hosted by the government and then as part of a small group of Googlers on a country visit , I learned more about how terrible the 1980s and 90s were in this small West African nation . GDP -- a crude measure of the health of a nation , but an indicator nonetheless -- dropped 90% as the country endured brutal dictatorship after brutal dictatorship . That decline is the largest in any nation since World War II , and nearly twice the percentage drop that Rwanda , Zimbabwe , and other states experienced during their crises . The good news is that although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , GDP has almost risen to pre-conflict levels during Johnson Sirleafs tenure , and foreign direct investment has returned . <p> The numbers also tell a third story . Throughout the 1960s and 70s Liberias economy grew at a steady pace in a way that most other African economies did not . The growth was inequitable -- but real -- and the ingenuity and entrepreneurship that drove it are on full display today , albeit in ways that can sometimes puzzle a visitor to the country . <p> During the ten days I was in Liberia my colleagues and I always had a driver ; its the only way for foreigners to get around . The first day we reserved our car for 9:00am but when I looked out the hotel window at 9:02am I noticed the car speeding off with three other passengers . When I frantically called the driver he responded , " My man , do n't  worry -- I will get you to your meeting on time . " And he did . Then there was the night a local friend suggested dinner by saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoor patio at the base of Sniper Hill . . . wait , that did n't  quite sound as inviting as I meant it . " When we arrived our waiter was Frankie , a cheerful eight-year old sporting an Alex Rodriguez Yankees jersey who delivered our food and drink on the jog . At the local family restaurant , everyone pitched in . <p> Like most of Africa , cell phones are ubiquitous in Liberia and are the technology of choice for the vast majority of the population . Our meetings with the mobile providers there could have taken place anywhere in the world . They 're making money but are fiercely competitive with one another , slashing prices and offering new products to gain market share , and desperately trying to expand into new markets like broadband . Their activities are far from philanthropic , but they 're arguably having a more positive affect on Liberians day-to-day life than any other segment of society . The mobile penetration rate is 40% and rising , particularly in rural areas where phones are often the first " big " purchase a Liberian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course noticeable here as well . Liberians will often carry SIM cards from different mobile carriers and switch back and forth depending on coverage and prices ( a noticeably nice option that 's not available in the locked-down U.S. market ) . Since unanswered calls do n't  incur a charge and the person who initiates the call pays more than the receiver , Liberians will also occasionally call and hang up , meaning , " I want talk to you but you can afford this more than I can , so call me back . " Scratch cards , which give you twenty or thirty minutes of talk time , are practically used as cash and are sold virtually everywhere . <p> The past thirty years have been difficult ones for most Liberians , and with an 80% unemployment rate and known war criminals still occupying high government offices , there are still huge problems to address . In the next two years the country will hold elections and most of the UN peacekeepers will withdraw . Watch closely : if both go well , a stable Liberia may finally be back . 
@@13269044 @1869044/ <h> Friday 1/28/2011 07:26:00 PM <p> Google.org continues to ramp up technology projects and test new ideas while Googles overall charitable giving , in-kind giving and employee volunteering have grown as well . Our newsletter outlines the latest updates to our philanthropic projects . I caught up with Megan Smith , VP New Business Development and General Manager of Google.org , to talk about how Google views philanthropy . <p> After two years at the helm of Google.org , what are you most optimistic about ? The Internet offers an opportunity to connect in ways never before possible . Things that have historically been far apart are now " virtually adjacent " most people are a text away , data sets can be mashed up , and all world knowledge is coming online from both expected and surprising sources . Given all of this , I am most excited about all the extraordinary ways people are using the web to connect , be informed , use data and to start solving problems together . <p> For Google.org specifically , we want to contribute our knowledge and skills to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more than 50 engineers and about 40 other cross-functional Googlers working on four or five larger projectslike Google Crisis Response and RE&lt;Cand over a dozen smaller experimental pilot projects . <p> What kind of project fits this opportunity ? One of our newer projects , Google Earth Engine , takes advantage of Googles computing infrastructure to create a planetary sciences computation platform that could help reduce negative environmental impact at scale . The first focus is on deforestation monitoring . Earth Engine has just made it through the pilot phase to a full project with its launch last month at climate change talks in Mexico . If we meet our goals to enable global-scale monitoring of changes in the planets environment , I believe that Earth Engine could play an important information role in helping to slow deforestation . <p> What 's the biggest lesson you 've learned since joining Google.org ? Two things : first , the opportunity we have is great ; and second , the work has served as a reminder that creating truly useful , innovative technology is challenging and requires patient iteration , dialog , teamwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , learn from the right partners , collaborate , pilot those ideas that pass initial assessment and then launch for scale the few projects that meet the criteria for a Google.org product . <p> Do Google.org projects have a specific focus ? We do n't  have a topical focuswe work on technology solutions to many different kinds of global challenges . The key is to take advantage of Googles strengths . In the area of global health , for example , we have been able to create a global flu monitoring system based on search data . For our environmental work , we were able to leverage our data center computing power to put together the finest-scale forest map of Mexico to date ( processing this data would take two years on one computer , but we made it in less than 24 hours using our computing infrastructure ) . <p> How does Google.org start and ramp up its technology projects ? We work to tap into the talent at Google . Some projects have come out of hallway conversations and others from extensive talks with partners in the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with senior engineers where talented individuals or teams within Google bring ideas or prototypes . If we think the idea is a match and has promise , we give it budget , headcount , guidance and time to see where it can go during a pilot period . Once we have a live pilot or project , we take advantage of Google.coms standard project review and management processes that our company has effectively used for years . <p> What if those pilots fail ? That 's normal . We should expect that some of them will fail or will only have smaller impact . If you 're not failing some of the time , you 're not taking risks . As we progress , some of our failures will hopefully teach us as much as some of our successes . <p> What other charitable giving does Google do ? As a company that has been doing well , its important that we push ourselves to be amongst the most generous companies . We have several charitable giving programs supporting , for example , education ( especially K-12 science and math programs ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions for underserved groups . Last year the company gave more than $145 million to non-profits and academic institutions , and more than $184 million when including Google Grants , Google.org technology projects and in-kind product support for non-profits . <p> How is this philanthropic work different from that of other companies ? Like other companies , we have charitable giving programs , we provide products in-kind and we have a range of employee volunteering programs . Some companies like ours may also have experiments like Google.org to leverage their strengthsa form of skills-based giving . However , many companies do amazing charitable work through a centralized Corporate Social Responsibility arm that tackles a key issue or two . We approach philanthropy the way we do our core business , with big goals and a " launch early and iterate " approach . Ideas come from all over the company and we work to tackle a range of issues we care about , from clean energy to education to development . It may not be as clean as the process that some others have , but we think this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain determined , as our founders said when they set the vision for Google.org , " to find original ways to extend our assets , so that we can drive scalable , sustainable efforts . ... the underlying principle : Never stop looking for ways to do the best with what you have . " <p> Currently , for every well that sends cold water down to the hot rock ( called injectors ) , there are one to three wells that bring heated water back up to generate electricity ( called producers ) . But what if one well could act as both an injector and producer ? It could dramatically lower the cost of EGS ( example below ) . The Stanford team , which included graduate students Zhe Wang and Mark McClure , modeled a variety of single-well configurations to determine their feasibility . The investigation determined that on a per well basis , an optimal single-well EGS system would produce four times more energy than an isolated pair of wells and two times more energy than an infinite series of alternating producers and injectors . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , present another innovative technique for advancing baseload EGS on the path to RE&lt;C . <p> On a trip to Jerusalem three years ago , Jonathan Rosenbergvisited Yad Vashem . Struck by the museum 's vast historical record housed within the physical building , he hoped Google could do something powerful to showcase this information . Inspired by the challenge , a few of us , in our " 20% time , " started working with Yad Vashem and eventually grew our effort into a full project , introducing a YouTube channel in 2008 and now this collections site . <p> Within the archive you will find more than 130,000 images in full resolution . You can search for them via a custom search engine on Yad Vashems collections site . And by using experimental optical character recognition ( OCR ) , we 've transcribed the text on many images , making them even more discoverable on the web . This means that if you search for the name of a family member who was in the Holocaust , you might find a link to an image on the Yad Vashem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , try searching for the term rena weiser , the name of a Jewish refugee . You 'll find a link to a visa issued to her by the Consulate of Chile in France . OCR technology made this picture discoverable to those searching for her . <p> Yad Vashem encourages you to add personal stories about images that have meaning for you in the " share your thoughts " section below each item . Doron Avni , a fellow Googler , has already added a story . He found a photograph of his grandfather taken immediately after his release from a Nazi prison . His grandfather had vowed that if he should survive , he would immediately have his picture taken to preserve the memory of his experience in the Holocaust . He stitched the photo into his coat , an act that later saved his life . After hiding in the forest for a year , Russian soldiers mistook him for a German enemy , but released him once they saw this picture . <p> Dorons grandfather <p> The Yad Vashem partnership is part of our larger effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in similar projects in the past including digitizing major libraries in Europe , collections at the Prado Museum in Madrid , and the LIFE photo archive . We encourage organizations interested in partnering with us in our archiving efforts to enter their information in this form . <p> Were proud to be launching this significant archive that will allow people to discover images that are part of their heritage , and will aid people worldwide researching the Holocaust . <h> Friday 1/21/2011 03:00:00 PM <p> How can students hone their marketing skills and help an NGO at the same time ?

With help from Professor John Brownstein and Emily Chan from HealthMap , a program at Childrens Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical School , we were able to create our system . Using the dengue case count data provided by Ministries of Health and the World Health Organization , were able to build a model that offers near real-time estimates of dengue activity based on the popularity of certain search terms . Google Dengue Trends is automatically updated every day , thereby providing an early indicator of dengue activity . <p> We hope the early warning provided by Google Dengue Trends helps health officials and the public prepare for potential dengue outbreaks . For those who live in places where dengue is present , remember to follow the advice of health officials to prevent infection by wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by gathering standing water . <h> Wednesday 5/25/2011 08:34:00 AM <p> It all started with the flu . In 2008 , we found that the activity of certain search terms are good indicators of actual flu activity . Based on this finding , we launched Google Flu Trends to provide timely estimates of flu activity in 28 countries . Since then , we 've seen a number of other researchersincluding our very ownuse search activity data to estimate other real world activities . <p> However , tools that provide access to search data , such as Google Trends or Google Insights for Search , werent designed with this type of research in mind . Those systems allow you to enter a search term and see the trend ; but researchers told us they want to enter the trend of some real world activity and see which search terms best match that trend . In other words , they wanted a system that was like Google Trends but in reverse . <p> This is now possible with Google Correlate , which were launching today on Google Labs . Using Correlate , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of search terms whose popularity best corresponds with that real world trend . In the example below , we uploaded official flu activity data from the U.S. CDC over the last several years and found that people search for terms like cold or flu in a similar pattern to actual flu rates . Finding out these correlated terms is how we built Google Flu Trends : <p> You can also enter a search term such as ribosome and find other terms whose activity corresponds well over time with the one you 're interested in : <p> It turns out cell biology is n't all too popular in the summer time ( sorry biologists ! ) . What 's interesting is that the ups and downs of web search activity for cell biology terms is unique enough that searching on Correlate for ribosome brings up searches for other biology terms , such as mitochondria . Of course , correlation is n't the same thing as causation , so we cant explain why two terms follow the same pattern . But my guess in this case is that both terms are popular when schools teach these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data that may lead to advances in economics , health and other fields ; but we need to handle that data with privacy controls in mind . With this system , we do n't  care what any one person is searching for . In fact , we rely on millions of anonymized search queries issued to Google over time , and the patterns we observe in the data are only meaningful across large populations . <h> Tuesday 5/24/2011 05:43:00 PM <p> Two years ago representatives from Google , Microsoft , Yahoo ! , Hewlett-Packard , NASA and the World Bank came together to form the Random Hacks of Kindness ( RHoK ) program . The idea was simple : technology can and should be used for good . RHoK brings together subject matter experts , volunteer software developers and designers to create open source and technology agnostic software solutions that address challenges facing humanity . On June 4-5 , 2011 well hold the third Random Hacks of Kindness global event at five U.S. locations and 13 international sites , giving local developer communities the opportunity to collaborate on problems in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications focused on crisis response such as ImOK , a mobile messaging application for disaster response that was used on the ground in Haiti and Chile ; and CHASM , a visual tool to map landslide risk currently being piloted by the World Bank in landslide affected areas in the Caribbean . Person Finder , a tool created by Googles crisis response team to help people find friends and loved ones after a natural disaster , was also refined at RHoK events and effectively deployed in Haiti , Chile and Japan . <p> Were inviting all developers , designers and anyone else who wants to help " hack for humanity , " to attend one of the local events on June 4-5 . There , you 'll meet other open source developers , work with experts in disaster and climate issues and contribute code to exciting projects that make a difference . If you 're in Northern California , come join us at the Silicon Valley RHoK event at Google headquarters . <p> And if you 're part of an organization that works in the fields of crisis response or climate change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developers and volunteers can work on developing technology to address the challenge . <p> Visit http : //www.rhok.org/ for more information and to sign up for your local event , and get set to put your hacking skills to good use . <h> Thursday 5/05/2011 02:42:00 PM <p> This morning Shona Brown , Senior Vice President of Google.org , was on Capitol Hill to testify before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on the use of technology in coordinating disaster relief efforts . <p> Google plays a modest role in crisis response compared to relief organizations and agencies , but we have found that the Internet can help users and relief workers quickly find the information they need during emergencies . For example , Google Person Finder which helps loved ones reconnect during emergencies managed more than 600,000 records following the earthquake in Japan , and there were more than 36 million page views within the first 48 hours alone . <p> During her testimony , Shona outlined three reasons how simple , standard and open Internet-based technologies are critical tools for emergency responders and affected populations : the Internet often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Internet services during emergencies , and the Internet scales and promotes openness . <h> 5/05/2011 02:40:00 PM <p> Last Thursday , the Google Map Maker team , along with the World Bank and UNITAR/UNOSAT , held a unique event at the World Bank Headquarters in Washington , D.C. , and a satellite event in Nairobi at the same time . More than 70 members of the Sudanese diaspora , along with regional experts from the World Bank , Sudan Institute , Voices for Sudan , The Enough Project and other organizations gathered together to map what is expected to become the worlds newest country later this year : the Republic of South Sudan . UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has asked the international community " to assist all Sudanese towards greater stability and development " during and beyond this period of transition . <p> South Sudan is a large but under-mapped region , and there are very few high-quality maps that display essential features like roads , hospitals and schools . Up-to-date maps are particularly important to humanitarian aid groups , as they help responders target their efforts and mobilize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally , maps are an important foundation for the development of the infrastructure and economy of the country and region . <p> The Map Maker communitya wide-ranging group of volunteers that help build more comprehensive maps of the world using our online mapping tool , Google Map Makerhas been contributing to the mapping effort for Sudan since the referendum on January 9 . To aid their work , we 've published updated satellite imagery of the region , covering 125,000 square kilometers and 40 percent of the U.N.s priority areas , to Google Earth and Maps . <p> The goal of last weeks event was to engage and train members of the Sudanese diaspora in the United States , and others who have lived and worked in the region , to use Google Map Maker so they could contribute their local knowledge of the region to the ongoing mapping effort , particularly in the area of social infrastructure . Our hope is that this event and others like it will help build a self-sufficient mapping community that will contribute their local expertise and remain engaged in Sudan over time . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us : " I used to live in this small village that before today did not exist on any maps that I know of ... a place unknown to the world . Now I can show to my kids , my friends , my community , where I used to live and better tell the story of my people . " <p> The group worked together to make several hundred edits to the map of Sudan in four hours . As those edits are approved , theyll appear live in Google Maps , available for all the world to see . But this wasnt just a one-day undertakingattendees will now return to their home communities armed with new tools and ready to teach their friends and family how to join the effort . We look forward to seeing the Southern Sudanese mapping community grow and flourish . <h> Tuesday 5/03/2011 05:02:00 PM <p> Over the years , the Google Earth Outreach team has seen hundreds of maps that nonprofits are using to change the world for the better . We 've also talked to just as many nonprofits who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but do n't  have people on their team with enough technical skills to create it . <p> Today , were excited to announce the Google Earth Outreach Developer Grants program , supporting selected projects from eligible nonprofit organizations that are using Googles mapping technologies in novel , innovative ways to make the world a better place . <p> Through this program , non-profit organizations from all over the world will have an opportunity to receive up to $20,000 that will help turn their mapping ideas to support their causes into a reality . Numerous nonprofits have already used Google Earth to raise awareness about an issue or cause that demonstrate innovation and creativity . The US Holocaust Memorial Museum and partners created the Crisis in Darfur Google Earth layer , which utilized Google Earths high-resolution satellite imagery to document the burning of villages , destruction of communities and livelihoods as a result of the genocide in Sudan . The presentation of refugee stories and testimonials in a map visualization brought 26 times the usual number of visitors to the USHMMs " How Can I Help ? " section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show donors precisely where the money they contributed was allocated . After donating , donors receive geographic coordinates to view the location of a well to which theyve contributed , and they can also view pictures of people accessing clean drinking water as a result of their contribution . <p> Charity:Water connects donors to well sites all over the globe . <p> Applications to the Google Earth Outreach Developer Grants program will be accepted until May 26 , 2011 .

Their doctors and paramedics have treated more than 100,000 people , many of whom are suffering from gastroenteritis , malaria and skin diseases . <p> In remarks during the opening plenary today , Eric Schmidt noted the importance of bringing 21st century technology solutions to disaster relief work . In collaboration with numerous NGOs , for example , Google developed Person Finder , an application that allows individuals to check on the status of friends and loved ones affected by a disaster , a few days after the Haiti earthquake . We developed Resource Finder , an experimental tool that aggregates information on health facilities to help first responders , and shared our MapMaker data with the U.N .

Disease spreads rapidly with over one billion people forced to defecate outside due to a lack of sanitation and indoor plumbing ; in fact , unsafe water and sanitation is the most important environmental cause of ill-health , with millions dying every year as a result of poor water , sanitation and hygiene conditions . Young children in particular tend to suffer from water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea . <p> Success in water supply and sanitation interventions is commonly measured in terms of the number of wells dug , public water points connected or public toilets constructed . This is what the official data - available at national scale only - reflect . The assumption is that every water point and every toilet will provide adequate and sustainable services to a fixed number of people . Too often , though , wells run dry , hand pumps break , toilets go " out-of-service , " or the quality of the water provided is not safe . <p> As a result the official data seriously underestimate the water and sanitation crisis .

A quarter of all new water points are no longer working just two years after installation . " <p> For Zanzibar , according to Graham Alabaster of UN-Habitat : " Counting only those who are paying less 10% of their income for water as having affordable access , the water access rate had to be revised from 90% down to 22% . " <p> Unfortunately this information implies that the water and sanitation crisis is affecting two to three times more people in the areas surveyed than the official data suggest . <p> Better data on water services can help consumers hold their water service provider accountable .

In 2007 , we committed to become a carbon neutral company . We know that it is n't possible to write a check and eliminate the environmental impact of our operations . So what does " carbon neutrality " mean to us ? <p> First , we aggressively pursue reductions in our energy consumption through energy efficiency , innovative infrastructure design and operations and on-site renewable energy . Our Google designed data centers use half the energy of typical facilities . We 're also working to accelerate the development of economic , clean renewable energy at scale through research and development , investment and policy outreach . At this time , however , such efforts do n't cover our entire carbon footprint . Therefore , since 2007 we 've gone a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover the portion of our footprint that we can not yet eliminate which is what we mean by " carbon neutrality . " <p> So what exactly is a carbon offset ? The idea behind an offset is that we pay someone to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in a specific , measurable way , thus offseting an equal climate impact on our side . To determine our impact , we calculate our annual carbon footprint , which is then verified by an independent third party . We include direct energy consumption ( like natural gas ) and electricity use , employee commuting , company vehicle use , business travel and estimates of carbon emissions from building construction and from the manufacturing of servers used in our datacenters . We then buy an equivalent number of carbon offsets . <p> While carbon offsets seem simple in principle , in practice they are surprisingly complicated . In particular , it 's often difficult to say whether or not the offset project results in emissions reductions that would have happened anyway . We find ourselves asking whether the project in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of offsets , this concept is referred to as " additionality . " Carbon offsets have a mixed reputation because some projects are not additional . Here at Google , we have set a very high bar to ensure that our investment makes an actual difference in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing offsets that are real , verifiable , permanent and additional . <p> To date , we have selected high quality carbon offsets from around the world that reduce greenhouse gas emissions ranging from landfill gas projects in Caldwell County , NC , and Steuben County , NY , to animal-waste management systems in Mexico and Brazil . Our funding helps make it possible for equipment to be installed that captures and destroys the methane gas produced as the waste decomposes . Methane , the primary component in natural gas , is a significant contributor to global warming . We chose to focus on landfill and agricultural methane reduction projects because methane 's impact on warming is very well understood , it 's easy to measure how much methane is captured and the capture would n't happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , they could n't make enough money selling the gas ) . <p> We need fundamental changes to global energy and transportation infrastructure to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions over the long term . In the meantime , the projects to which we contribute offer measurable emissions reductions and allow us to take responsibility for our carbon footprint . To that end , we 're always looking for good emissions-reduction projects to support . If you have a landfill gas or agricultural methane carbon offset project you think we should consider , please visit this page for more information about how to participate in our latest carbon-offset procurement round . <h> Wednesday 12/16/2009 02:37:00 PM <p> I 'm here in Copenhagen this week , at the COP15 International Climate Change Conference . Whether you 're attending in-person , or reading news headlines from home , you ca n't miss the fact that addressing climate change requires the world to solve a mind-boggling mix of science , policy and political issues . These are formidable challenges , but new technologies can help provide solutions for these complex problems . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an accord to compensate countries for preserving forests and other natural landscapes that play a crucial role in reducing emissions . Implementation of the agreement , known as Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Forest Degradation , or REDD , will require the ability to accurately track deforestation at a regional and global level . <p> Despite the widespread availability of global satellite imagery through products like Google Earth and Google Maps , it has n't been easy for tropical nations to understand the state of their ecosystem , and to quantitatively monitor changes in forest coverage or other key indicators . That 's why I 'm proud to announce a new computational platform for global-scale analysis of satellite imagery : Earth Engine , powered by Google . <p> At an event today hosted by Avoided Deforestation Partners , global leaders from the President of Guyana to the Prime Minister of Norway expressed their support for REDD . Earlier today , the U.S , Australia , France , Japan , Norway and Britain pledged $3.5 billion over the next three years to protect rainforests . At the event , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth Engine that we developed together with the Carnegie Institution for Science , IMAZON and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation . Traditional forest monitoring is complex and expensive , requiring access to large amounts of satellite data , lots of hard drives to hold the data , lots of computers to process the data , and lots of time while you wait for various computations to finish . Our prototype demonstrates how Earth Engine makes all of this easier , by moving everything into the cloud . Google supplies data , storage , and computing muscle . As a result , you can visualize forest change in fractions of a second over the web , instead of the minutes or hours that traditional offline systems require for such analysis . The prototype applications running on Earth Engine are n't yet available to the public , but you can see screen shots in our earlier blog post . <p> We want to ensure this technology is widely available when it 's ready , so today I formally announced Google.org 's commitment to provide our Earth Engine free to tropical countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is just the first of many Earth Engine applications that will help enable scientists , policymakers , and the general public to better monitor and understand the Earth 's ecosystems . <h> Tuesday 12/15/2009 09:39:00 AM <p> People often get up in settings like the international climate change conference in Copenhagen and make complicated pronouncements that leave heads spinning . Today was different . Google , GE , the Climate Group , and NRDC , supported by other leading businesses and NGOs , had a simple message : governments across the world should ensure people have real-time access to their home energy information . <p> Most of us know little about how we use energy in our homes , other than what our monthy power bill tells us . Yet studies show that when people can see in real-time how much energy they are using , they save up to 15% on their electricity use with simple behavioral changes , and even more with investments in energy efficiency . The savings are huge when added up : if all US households reduced 15% of their energy use by 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road and would save consumers $46 billion on their energy bills . <p> As 40,000 people gather in Copenhagen to fight global warming , we think that 's a solution that governments should be paying attention to . This group , which will take other actions after the meeting has ended , has begun a push to give ordinary citizens the tools to save money and save the planet . A lot of the decisions on the table in Copenhagen are hard , we believe this one is simple . <h> Thursday 12/10/2009 04:59:00 AM <p> Today , at the International Climate Change Conference ( COP15 ) in Copenhagen , we demonstrated a new technology prototype that enables online , global-scale observation and measurement of changes in the earth 's forests . We hope this technology will help stop the destruction of the world 's rapidly-disappearing forests . Emissions from tropical deforestation are comparable to the emissions of all of the European Union , and are greater than those of all cars , trucks , planes , ships and trains worldwide . According to the Stern Review , protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut carbon emissions and mitigate climate change . The United Nations has proposed a framework known as REDD ( Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries ) that would provide financial incentives to rainforest nations to protect their forests , in an effort to make forests worth " more alive than dead . " Implementing a global REDD system will require that each nation have the ability to accurately monitor and report the state of their forests over time , in a manner that is independently verifiable . However , many of these tropical nations of the world lack the technological resources to do this , so we 're working with scientists , governments and non-profits to change this . Here 's what we 've done with this prototype to help nations monitor their forests : <p> Start with satellite imagerySatellite imagery data can provide the foundation for measurement and monitoring of the world 's forests . For example , in Google Earth today , you can fly to Rondonia , Brazil and easily observe the advancement of deforestation over time , from 1975 to 2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of imagery data past , present and future is available all over the globe . Even so , while today you can view deforestation in Google Earth , until now there has n't been a way to measure it . <p> Then add scienceWith this technology , it 's now possible for scientists to analyze raw satellite imagery data and extract meaningful information about the world 's forests , such as locations and measurements of deforestation or even regeneration of a forest . In developing this prototype , we 've collaborated with Greg Asner of Carnegie Institution for Science , and Carlos Souza of Imazon . Greg and Carlos are both at the cutting edge of forest science and have developed software that creates forest cover and deforestation maps from satellite imagery . Organizations across Latin America use Greg 's program , Carnegie Landsat Analysis System ( CLASlite ) , and Carlos ' program , Sistema de Alerta de Deforestation ( SAD ) , to analyze forest cover change . However , widespread use of this analysis has been hampered by lack of access to satellite imagery data and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloudWhat if we could offer scientists and tropical nations access to a high-performance satellite imagery-processing engine running online , in the " Google cloud " ? And what if we could gather together all of the earths raw satellite imagery data petabytes of historical , present and future data and make it easily available on this platform ? We decided to find out , by working with Greg and Carlos to re-implement their software online , on top of a prototype platform we 've built that gives them easy access to terabytes of satellite imagery and thousands of computers in our data centers . <p> Here are the results of running CLASlite on the satellite imagery sequence shown above : <p> CLASlite online - This shows deforestation and degradation in Rondonia , Brazil from 1986-2008 , with the red indicating recent activity <p> Here 's the result of running SAD in a region of recent deforestation pressure in Mato Grosso , Brazil : <p> SAD online - The red " hotspots " indicate deforestation that has happened within the last 30 days <p> Combining science with massive data and technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unprecedented speed : On a top-of-the-line desktop computer , it can take days or weeks to analyze deforestation over the Amazon . Using our cloud-based computing power , we can reduce that time to seconds . Being able to detect illegal logging activities faster can help support local law enforcement and prevent further deforestation from happening . <p> Ease of use and lower costs : An online platform that offers easy access to data , scientific algorithms and computation horsepower from any web browser can dramatically lower the cost and complexity for tropical nations to monitor their forests . <p> Security , privacy and transparency : Governments and researchers do n't want to share sensitive data and results before they are ready . Our cloud-based platform allows users to control access to their data and results . At the same time , because the data , analysis and results reside online , they can also be easily shared , made available for collaboration , presented to the public and independently verified when appropriate . <p> Climate change impact : We think that a suitably scaled-up and enhanced version of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitoring , reporting and verification ( MRV ) in support of efforts such as REDD . <p> As a Google.org product , this technology will be provided to the world as a not-for-profit service . This technology prototype is currently available to a small set of partners for testing purposes it 's not yet available to the general public but we expect to make it more broadly available over the next year . We are grateful to a host of individuals and organizations ( find full list here ) who have advised us on developing this technology . In particular , we would like to thank the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation for their close partnership since the initial inception of this project . The goal of the Moore Foundations Environmental Conservation Program is to change the ways in which people use important terrestrial and coastal marine ecosystems to conserve critical ecological systems and functions , while allowing sustainable use . We 're also working with the Group on Earth Observations ( GEO ) , a consortium of national government bodies , inter-governmental organizations , space agencies and research institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . Last month together we launched the GEO FCT portal and are now exploring how we can also together bring the power of this new technology to tropical nations . <p> We 're excited to be able to share this early prototype and look forward to seeing what 's possible . <h> Tuesday 12/08/2009 11:22:00 AM <p> Last Monday , we hosted experts from the U.S. Department of Energy , MIT , Stanford , UC Berkeley , Nth Power and Google for a discussion on clean energy innovation in our San Francisco office . The panelists focused on the important role innovation plays in seizing the economic benefits of developing and deploying cost-effective low carbon technologies . <p> These policies , if adopted and supported , will help us at last put in place what has been lacking in terms of clean energy innovation : a robust pipeline extending from basic research to applied research to demonstration projects to commercial scale-up to full deployment . At Google , we call this cycle " Lightbulbs to Lightbulbs " -- from the initial " lightbulb moment " of invention to full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the whole process . Ignoring any of these steps can inhibit the effectiveness of the whole innovation cycle . <p> Watch the full event here : <p> With equal measures of smart policy , investment and will , we can realize the great role clean energy innovation can play to solving climate change and boosting the American economy . <h> Wednesday 12/02/2009 11:06:00 AM <p> Today Governor Schwarzenegger and the California Natural Resources Agency is announcing CalAdapt , a new Google Earth-based tool designed to help Californians learn more about climate impacts and adaptation . The Stockholm Environmental Institute ( SEI ) helped develop the CalAdapt prototype with support from the California Energy Commission and Google.org . SEI has been a leader in developing an international network of interactive climate adaptation tools , as you can see at WeAdapt . CalAdapt is still in Beta , but the goal for this interactive tool is to bring science to the people . <p> And California has the science .

This was especially true for the categories " influenza complications " and " term for influenza . " This is not unexpected , since differing complications and the fact that H1N1 began spreading during the northern hemisphere summer rather than winter likely played a role .

Several years ago Google.org provided $1,450,000 in funding to the Carter Center to support the eradication of this debilitating , 3,000 year old disease from Ghana . Its now been 14 months since the last case of Guinea worm was reported there . <p> This is a fantastic accomplishment that took a lot of hard work by the Carter Center , the Ministry of Health and their partners . There is no drug to prevent the infection of Guinea worm disease . Thus , our funds supported health education , as village-based health workers were trained to educate people about the origins of the disease and how to prevent it . In addition , these health workers mobilized to treat water sources , advocate for the provision of clean water , and monitor and contain cases of Guinea worm . With our funds in 2008 , the Carter Center achieved an 85% reduction in cases--the largest year over year percentage reduction seen in the history of the program ! Ghana now enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certification of its success . <p> Guinea worm is caused by a roundworm that lays its larvae in water . When people drink the infected water the larvae hatch inside them and can grow up to 3 feet in length before painfully emerging through their skin about a year later . There 's no way of knowing where the worm will emerge . Its not unusual for it to exit near the ankle or foot , which impairs the victims movement and ability to work . Its a slow and painful process to remove the worm without breaking it off in the patient . Often , affected individuals seek relief by submerging their sores in water , at which point the worm releases new larvae into the water and the cycle continues . <p> In 1986 , when the Carter Center began the campaign to eradicate Guinea worm , there were more than 3.5 million cases across 20 countries in Asia and Africa . Today , only 3 countries remain : South Sudan , Mali and Ethiopia . So far this year only 800 cases have been reported . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eradicated .

Repair of city infrastructure and tourism ( the primary economic source for this part of the nation ) are slow and stagnant in much of the region . We will be successful in turning around these trends only if we come together and rededicate ourselves to this effort .

Notable exceptions to this shut down were two organizations to which I have personal ties - St. Bernard Project and The Idea Village . <p> St. Bernard Project is a nonprofit , community-based organization that began rebuilding homes in August 2006 ( boasting 177 projects to date ) that were damaged by flood waters from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in St. Bernard Parish , Louisiana . St. Bernard Parish is a working class community and was one of the hardest hit parishes of the city because of its location just 5 miles from the now infamous Industrial Levee . <p> The Idea Village is an organization working to accelerate the growth of the entrepreneurial community in the embattled New Orleans region .

The Idea Village 's motto is " Trust Your Crazy Ideas , " but I do n't see anything crazy about wanting to rebuild one of America 's greatest cities . <p> The highlight of the trip was that at each build site , the families whose homes we were returning to their former grace stopped by to say hello , offer their gratitude and recount the stories of survival . Andrea was the owner of the home I was rebuilding . She was the mother of two small children and was anxious to return a sense of normalcy to all of their lives .

Even with all of the progress made to get people back into their homes , communities are fractured and without basic services and business opportunities . <p> On the final day of our trip , we went to the Upper and Lower Ninth Ward , the areas most devastated by the hurricanes . The neighborhoods were absent of life ; there is little or nothing for residents to come back to . But signs of hope included children riding bikes , families and neighbors barbecuing on the front lawns of their homes ( many still tattooed with the post storm FEMA markings ) and a few bold projects such as the The Musicians ' Village and Brad Pitt 's Make it Right project .

Back in 2008 , a team at Google dug into this behavior and found that certain search terms were good indicators of flu levels . We later launched Google Flu Trends to estimate flu activity in near real-time using aggregated Google search data , in regions around the world . <p> At the end of every flu season , we evaluate the performance of our model . Are our estimates accurate ? What worked well , or not so well ? Do we need to make any updates ? After the 2009 H1N1 season , for example , we updated the model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2009 , the model had performed well at the national and regional levels in the US and no update was needed . <p> Flu Trends can help estimate the start , peak , and duration of each flu season--all important information for public health agencies . During the 2012-2013 season in the US , the model performed well in estimating the start and duration of the season . However , the model overestimated the severity of the flu . In January 2013 , after spotting the difference between our estimates and the percentage of healthcare visits for influenza-like illnesses ( ILI ) reported by the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) , we started to investigate the high estimates . We found that heightened media coverage on the severity of the flu season resulted in an extended period in which users were searching for terms we 've identified as correlated with flu levels . In early 2013 , we saw more flu-related searches in the US than ever before . <p> We evaluated several options to improve the model . Ultimately , we determined that an update using the peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity for recent seasons . We will be applying this update to the US flu level estimates for the 2013-2014 flu season , starting from August 1st . A casual observer will see that the new model forecasts a lower flu level than last years model did at a similar time in the season . We believe the new model more closely approximates CDC data . <p> You can check out the new models estimates against previous years flu levels in this graph : <p> For those of you who want more data and details , we presented this paper recently at the ISNTD Bites conference . This is an iterative process . We will keep exploring how we can build resilience to accommodate the effect of news media . In the meantime , stay healthy ! <h> Wednesday 10/23/2013 12:02:00 PM <p> A catastrophe or natural disaster can occur when least expected .

Our goal at Google Crisis Response is to provide citizens with the critical information needed in an emergency . Were able to provide Public Alerts and Crisis Map in Colombia thanks to the support of the Colombian Institute of Hydrology , Meteorology and Environmental Studies ( IDEAM ) and the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management ( UNGRD ) . Colombia is the first country in Latin America to implement the system .

Some enter through the policy door , seeking better rules to mandate emissions reductions . Others enter through the investment door , seeking profit from carbon markets and clean technologies . And an increasing number of participants come through the global development door , seeking " climate justice " for poor populations effected by global warming . As Meena Raman of Friends of the Earth International in Malaysia explained , " We all agree that climate change is happening , but now we have to ask the question of how to share the burden of adjustment . " <p> Just how large that " burden of adjustment " will be is uncertain , but the UN Human Development Report released in anticipation of UN Conference proclaims that " climate change is the defining human development challenge of the 21st Century " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stall and then reverse international efforts to reduce poverty . " The idea of climate justice comes into play when considering who will pay for climate adaptation when those countries that have done the least to cause global warming bear the greatest cost . Different groups here in Bali have even attempted to put a dollar amount to the cost of adaptation . Oxfam , for example , estimates the cost to be $50 billion per year and far more if emissions are not cut rapidly . <p> For many NGOs in Bali , climate change offers an opportunity to engage a new community of stakeholders and introduce ideas of environmental equity into the debate . Victoria Tauli-Corpuz , the Chairperson of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues , described the phenomenon as a " moment to challenge traditional development paradigms . " Local organizations such as the Indonesian Civil Society Forum for Climate Justice have sprung up in the past year to address the climate challenge while more established NGOs such as UNICEF have begun to incorporate work on climate justice and adaptation into their work . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bali focus on climate justice and adaptation , they are still a relatively small percentage of the overall NGO representation at the conference . Michael Dorsey from Dartmouth College and the Durban Group for Climate Justice points out that the International Emissions Trading Association ( IETA ) still dominates in Bali with 336 representatives making up 8% of all NGOs listed . That is equal to more than the delegation of Greenpeace ( 2% ) , the World Wildlife Fund ( 1.6% ) and Friends of the Earth ( 1.5% ) combined . <p> One silver lining that is gaining momentum here in Bali is the idea of " green jobs " created in the new energy economy . Most admit that further research on this topic is necessary to determine which sectors of society will benefit most from these jobs , but the concept resonates with many climate justice advocates in search for solutions .

Whether you 're attending in-person , or reading news headlines from home , you ca n't miss the fact that addressing climate change requires the world to solve a mind-boggling mix of science , policy and political issues . These are formidable challenges , but new technologies can help provide solutions for these complex problems . For example , one of the most promising areas of compromise has been an accord to compensate countries for preserving forests and other natural landscapes that play a crucial role in reducing emissions . Implementation of the agreement , known as Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Forest Degradation , or REDD , will require the ability to accurately track deforestation at a regional and global level . <p> Despite the widespread availability of global satellite imagery through products like Google Earth and Google Maps , it has n't been easy for tropical nations to understand the state of their ecosystem , and to quantitatively monitor changes in forest coverage or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announce a new computational platform for global-scale analysis of satellite imagery : Earth Engine , powered by Google . <p> At an event today hosted by Avoided Deforestation Partners , global leaders from the President of Guyana to the Prime Minister of Norway expressed their support for REDD . Earlier today , the U.S , Australia , France , Japan , Norway and Britain pledged $3.5 billion over the next three years to protect rainforests . At the event , I demonstrated a prototype forest monitoring application built on top of Earth Engine that we developed together with the Carnegie Institution for Science , IMAZON and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation . Traditional forest monitoring is complex and expensive , requiring access to large amounts of satellite data , lots of hard drives to hold the data , lots of computers to process the data , and lots of time while you wait for various computations to finish . Our prototype demonstrates how Earth Engine makes all of this easier , by moving everything into the cloud . Google supplies data , storage , and computing muscle . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a second over the web , instead of the minutes or hours that traditional offline systems require for such analysis . The prototype applications running on Earth Engine are n't yet available to the public , but you can see screen shots in our earlier blog post . <p> We want to ensure this technology is widely available when it 's ready , so today I formally announced Google.org 's commitment to provide our Earth Engine free to tropical countries to support their forest monitoring programs . I believe that this is just the first of many Earth Engine applications that will help enable scientists , policymakers , and the general public to better monitor and understand the Earth 's ecosystems . 
@@13269112 @1869112/ <h> Wednesday 10/15/2008 01:45:00 PM <p> Today is Blog Action Day , an annual event that rallies blogs around the world to post about a common cause . This year 's issue up for discussion is poverty , so we wanted to take a look at the relationship between access to information and social and economic development . The right information at the right time in the hands of people has enormous power . As someone who works for Google , I see evidence of this everyday as people search and find information they need to create knowledge , grow their business , or access essential services . But that applies primarily to the rich world , where economies are built on knowledge and presume access to information . What about the poor and developing countries where people are offline more than online ? How do they benefit from the power of information ? <p> In much of Sub-Saharan Africa , for example , rates of economic growth over the last decade have exceeded 5% every year . Despite this trend , poverty in many countries has remained constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate was 48% in 1981 . According to the Kenya Poverty and Inequality Assessment released by the World Bank this year , 17 million Kenyans or 47% of the population were unable to meet the costs of food sufficient to fulfill basic daily caloric requirements . The vast majority of these people live in rural areas and have even less access to the information that impacts their daily life . Data on water quality , education and health budgets , and agricultural prices are nearly impossible to access . <p> Despite hundreds of millions of dollars spent each year on providing basic public services like primary education , health , water , and sanitation to poor communities , poverty in much of Sub-Saharan Africa persists . Where does this money go , who gets it , and what are the results of the resources invested ? That 's where we find a big black hole of information and a lack of basic accountability . How do inputs ( dollars spent ) turn into outputs ( schools , clinics , and wells ) , and , more importantly , how do outputs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , etc . ) ? <p> We simply do n't  know the answers to most of these basic questions . But what if we could ? What if a mother could find out how much money was budgeted for her daughter 's school each year and how much of it was received ? What if she and other parents could report how often teachers are absent from school or whether health clinics have the medicines they are supposed to carry ? What if citizens could access and report on basic information to determine value for money as tax payers ? <p> The work of SODNET in Kenya is illustrative . They are developing a simple budget-tracking tool that allows citizens to track the allocation , use , and ultimate result of government funds earmarked for infrastructure projects in their districts . The tool is intended to create transparency in the use of tax revenues and answer the simple question : Are resources reaching their intended beneficiaries ? Using tools like maps , they are able to overlay information that begins to tell a compelling story . <p> Google.orgs role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to support , catalyze , and widely disseminate this kind of information to public , private , and civil society stakeholders that can use it to see more clearly what 's working , what 's broken and what are potential solutions . Leveraging platforms like Google Earth and Google Maps can help organizations disseminate their content widely and let people see and understand what was once invisible . Once information is visible , widely known , and easy to understand , we are betting that governments and citizens will pay more attention to leakages in the service delivery pipeline and feel empowered to propose solutions . <p> You ca n't change what you cant see . The power to know plus the power to act on what you know is the surest way to achieve positive social change from the bottom up . And when we consider the magnitude of resources invested in delivering public services each year , a 10% improvement globally would exceed the value of all foreign aid . We believe that is a bet worth making .

As part of the Google.org Geo Challenge Grants Program , Rocky Mountain Institute ( RMI ) has created a map of US oil imports by country since 1973 . By clicking on the green light to play , you can see the countries supplying oil to the U.S. ( either in terms of barrels or dollar value ) and how our imports have changed over the last 35 years.The thicker the line in the map , the more oil produced or imported . While this map highlights data on United States oil imports , the picture is similar for every oil-importing country in the world . <p> The map highlights 5 eras of oil consumption , from the oil shocks of the 1970s to the price collapse in the 1980s to recent events including Hurricane Katrina and gas approaching $5 per gallon before retreating rapidly recently . ( You can see these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the RMI website . ) One interesting time period is from 1982 to 1985 , when low prices caused oil imports from the Middle East to decline to very low levels . <p> The map also looks at potential oil from offshore drilling and exploration of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) . The screenshot below illustrates the impact of off-shore drilling . With the map zoomed or drilled 3-5 levels down and centered near Alabama ( and the map pushpin that represents offshore ) , check out the very thin line that shows the potential peak production of 220,000 barrels per day.The lines represent estimates of production in 20-30 years , and even with this very long timeline , the amount of oil that could be generated from offshore drilling is miniscule compared to our oil needs today . <p> Both Google and RMI are working hard to help create a future where we are not reliant on daily imports of millions of barrels of oil that pollute our atmosphere and risk our national security . <p> Today , along with the Brookings Institution , RMI is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify solutions to break Americas dependence on oil , with Google in attendance .

In our Clean Energy 2030 Plan we show that increasing conventional automobile mileage , deploying millions of plug-in hybrids and accelerating the turnover of the fleet would reduce oil consumption by 51% by 2030 . That decrease would have an even larger effect on oil imports because we produce about one-third of our oil in the US . Google and RMI have worked together on a number of projects including RMIs Smart GarageCharrette , a summit to identify the barriers and breakthroughs needed to electrify the U.S. auto fleet . <p> While oil prices have declined rapidly over the past five months , most people expect oil prices to remain high into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop in oil prices reduces the need to act , President-Elect Barack Obama responded that we go from " shock to trance " and as a result " never make any progress .

Google Earth Engine is a new technology platform that puts an unprecedented amount of satellite imagery and datacurrent and historicalonline for the first time . It enables global-scale monitoring and measurement of changes in the earths environment . The platform will enable scientists to use our extensive computing infrastructurethe Google " cloud " to analyze this imagery . Last year , we demonstrated an early prototype . Since then , we have developed the platform , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Earth Engine to implement their applications . <p> Why is this important ? The images of our planet from space contain a wealth of information , ready to be extracted and applied to many societal challenges . Scientific analysis can transform these images from a mere set of pixels into useful informationsuch as the locations and extent of global forests , detecting how our forests are changing over time , directing resources for disaster response or water resource mapping . <p> The challenge has been to cope with the massive scale of satellite imagery archives , and the computational resources required for their analysis . As a result , many of these images have never been seen , much less analyzed . Now , scientists will be able to build applications to mine this treasure trove of data on Google Earth Engine , providing several advantages : <p> Landsat satellite data archives over the last 25 years for most of the developing world available online , ready to be used together with other datasets including MODIS . And we will soon offer a complete global archive of Landsat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure . By running analyses across thousands of computers , for example , unthinkable tasks are now possible for the first time . <p> New features that will make analysis easier , such as tools that pre-process the images to remove clouds and haze . <p> Collaboration and standardization by creating a common platform for global data analysis . <p> Google Earth Engine can be used for a wide range of applicationsfrom mapping water resources to ecosystem services to deforestation . Its part of our broader effort at Google to build a more sustainable future . Were particularly excited about an initial use of Google Earth Engine to support development of systems to monitor , report and verify ( MRV ) efforts to stop global deforestation . <p> Deforestation releases a significant amount of carbon into the atmosphere , accounting for 12-18% of annual greenhouse gas emissions . The world loses 32 million acres of tropical forests every year , an area the size of Greece . The United Nations has proposed a framework known as REDD ( Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests . Reaching an agreement on early development of REDD is a key agenda item here in Cancun . <p> Today , we announced that we are donating 10 million CPU-hours a year over the next two years on the Google Earth Engine platform , to strengthen the capacity of developing world nations to track the state of their forests , in preparation for REDD . For the least developed nations , Google Earth Engine will provide critical access to terabytes of data , a growing set of analytical tools and our high-performance processing capabilities . We believe Google Earth Engine will bring transparency and more certainty to global efforts to stop deforestation . <p> Weve been working with several partners to fully develop this platform . In particular , the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation has been a key strategic and funding partner . The Moore Foundation has also committed over $12 million dollars through its Environmental Conservation Program to projects that support the development of Google Earth Engine . The Moore Foundations Environment Program finances practical , enduring solutions to environmental challenges and works to improve the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coastal marine ecosystems to create working land and seascapes that support resilient and productive ecosystems for current and future generations . Theyve funded the U.S. Geological Survey to scale their infrastructure and accelerate bringing historic Landsat data off tape , and online , through Google Earth Engine . <p> This animation shows the breadth and depth of the Landsat archive that has been uploaded into Google Earth Engine to date . We are grateful to the USGS for their ongoing technical collaboration . <p> Support from the Moore Foundation includes funding for several scientists to develop and integrate their desktop software to work online with the data available in Google Earth Engine . Those scientists -- Greg Asner of the Carnegie Institution for Science and Carlos Souza of Imazon -- are also key partners , along with Matt Hansen of the Geographic Information Science Center at South Dakota State University . All are at the cutting edge of forest monitoring in support of climate science . <p> In collaboration with Matt Hansen and CONAFOR , Mexicos National Forestry Commission , we 've produced a forest cover and water map of Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to date . The map required 15,000 hours of computation , but was completed in less than a day on Google Earth Engine , using 1,000 computers over more than 53,000 Landsat scenes ( 1984-2010 ) . CONAFOR provided National Forest Inventory ground-sampled data to calibrate and validate the algorithm . <p> A forest cover and water map of Mexico ( southern portion , including the Yucatan peninsula ) , produced in collaboration with scientist Matthew Hansen and CONAFOR . <p> We hope that Google Earth Engine will be an important tool to help institutions around the world manage forests more wisely . As we fully develop the platform , we hope more scientists will use new Earth Engine API to integrate their applications onlinefor deforestation , disease mitigation , disaster response , water resource mapping and other beneficial uses .

There is a vital interdependency between communities and the trees they rely on for survival . Trees are our watersheds , protectors of the natural environment , and sources of food . Remove the trees from the equation and the community feels the impact . <p> I came to this realization in the 1970s in Kenya . I was talking to women in my community about their problems : hunger , access to water , poverty , wood fuel . I saw a link between their needs and the condition of the land and thought , " Why not plant trees to address these issues ? " Trees hold the soil to the ground so that we can grow food in it , they protect watersheds and facilitate harvesting of rain water , fruits trees supplement food and trees give us domestic energy and wood with which to build our shelters . So while still working at the University of Nairobi , I established a tree nursery in my backyard , planted seven trees at a public park and founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities , to build their capacity to restore Africa 's forests and put an end to the problems that deforestation and other forms of environmental degradation cause . As a result of this idea , more than 40 million trees have been planted to restore the environment and improve the lives of the people who are linked to the land . <p> When we were offered a unique opportunity to partner with the Google Earth Outreach team on a project using new Google Earth technology to visualize trees in 3D , we were thrilled . For accuracy and integrity we worked very closely with Google , advising them on the modeling of unique African trees like the broad-leaved Croton , the Nile tulip tree and the East African Cordia . These tree models illustrate the biodiversity in our tree planting sites , especially in the forests , and how we carefully select trees that are indigenous and sustainable to the natural surroundings . <p> Broad-leaved Croton , the Nile tulip tree and the East African Cordia ( from left to right ) <p> We then used data from real planting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth and create 3D visualizations .

It helps people come together to address common problems and work collectively towards community improvement and sustainability . I hope that seeing our beautiful tree planting sites in 3D on Google Earth will be a source of inspiration for people to engage , plant trees and organize planting activities in their own communities .

This work , based on results from field work in Kenya , was funded by one of the first Google.org grants and shows that novel water treatment products ( one of which is marketed under the name WaterGuard ) for home use can be cost-effective ways to reduce diarrhea , a major cause of child mortality . In contrast to the research that Alix and I refer to , Whittington 's challenge paper is more pessimistic about whether water and sanitation interventions are the best use of scarce resources that are supposed to improve the lives of the poor . They base this claim mostly on the expense of the technologies they consider ( wells , piped water and sewerage ) . <p> In our review , Alix and I argue that a key reason that water services are not working for the poor is the same reason why other public services are failing the poor : a lack of accountability between providers , policymakers , and consumers that has resulted in bad management and governance . The best technologies in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premise of Google.orgs Inform and Empower Initiative . We believe that accountability is linked to information quality and information flows .

The Inform and Empower initiative supports activities that make this information available and actionable . <p> Tomorrow the panel of 8 economic experts , including 5 Nobel prize winners , will determine its ranking of the Copenhagen Consensus 08 solutions .

@@13269120 @1869120/ <h> Wednesday 10/01/2008 10:33:00 AM <p> Right now the U.S. has a very real opportunity to transform our economy from one running on fossil fuels to one largely based on clean energy . We are developing the technologies and know-how to accomplish this . We can build whole new industries and create millions of new jobs . We can reduce energy costs , both at the gas pump and at home . We can improve our national security . And we can put a big dent in climate change . With strong leadership we could be moving forward on an aggressive but realistic timeline and an approach that balances costs with real economic gains . <p> The energy team at Google has been crunching the numbers to see how we could greatly reduce fossil fuel use by 2030 . Our analysis , led by Jeffery Greenblatt , suggests a potential path to weaning the U.S. off of coal and oil for electricity generation by 2030 ( with some remaining use of natural gas as well as nuclear ) , and cutting oil use for cars by 40% . Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , getting us to carbon-free electricity even sooner . We hope the American public pushes our leaders to embrace it . T. Boone Pickens has weighed in with an interesting plan of his own to massively deploy wind energy , among other things . Other plans have also been developed in recent years that merit attention . <p> Our goal in presenting this first iteration of the Clean Energy 2030 proposal is to stimulate debate and we invite you to take a look and comment - or offer an alternative approach if you disagree . With a new Administration and Congress - and multiple energy-related imperatives - this is an opportune , perhaps unprecedented , moment to move from plan to action . <p> Over 22 years this plan could generate billions of dollars in savings and help create millions of green jobs . Many of these high quality , good-paying jobs will be in today 's coal and oil producing states . <p> To get there we need immediate action on three fronts : <p> ( 1 ) Reduce demand by doing more with less <p> We should start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency -- adopting technologies and practices that allow us to do more with less . At Google , we 've seen the benefits of this approach . We identified $5M in building efficiency investments with a 2.5 year payback . We 've also designed our own data centers to run more efficiently , and we believe they are the most efficient in the world . On a smaller scale , personal computers can also become much more efficient . A typical desktop PC wastes nearly half the power it consumes . Last year , Bill Weihl , our Green Energy Czar , worked with industry partners to create the Climate Savers Computing Initiative to raise energy efficiency standards for personal computers and servers . If we meet our goals , these standards will cut energy consumption by the equivalent of 10-20 coal-fired power plants by 2010 . <p> Government can have a big impact on achieving greater efficiency . California 's aggressive building codes , efficiency standards and utility programs have helped the state keep per-capita energy use flat for years , while consumption in much of the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national level would help even more . <p> We also need to give the American people opportunities to be more efficient . The way we buy electricity today is like going to a store without seeing prices : we pick what we want , and receive an unintelligible bill at the end of the month . When homes are equipped with smart meters and real-time pricing , research shows that energy use typically drops . Google is looking at ways that we can use our information technology and our reach to help increase awareness and bring better , real-time information to consumers . <p> ( 2 ) Develop renewable energy that is cheaper than coal ( RE&lt;C ) <p> Googles data centers draw from a U.S. electricity grid that relies on coal for 50% of its power . We want to help catalyze the development of renewable energy that is price competitive with coal . At least three technologies show tremendous promise : wind , solar thermal , and advanced geothermal . Each of these is abundant and , when combined , could supply energy in virtually every region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $45 million in startup companies with breakthrough wind , solar and geothermal technologies through our Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal ( RE&lt;C ) initiative , but that is a drop when we need a flood . We need to unleash massive private investment in clean energy . The government can have a big impact here as well . We must dramatically increase federal R&amp;D and enact measures supporting the rapid deployment and scaling of clean technologies such as long-term tax support and a national renewable energy standard . Tax credits for wind and solar have lapsed several times in the last 20 years , starving these nascent industries of the capital they need to truly enter the mainstream . <p> We also must work both sides of the RE&lt;C equation . Progress will be accelerated when the price of carbon reflects its true costs to society . Putting a price on carbon through cap-and-trade or a carbon tax would help address this . <p> ( 3 ) Electrify transportation and re-invent our electric grid <p> Imagine driving a car that uses no gas and is less expensive to recharge than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to charge when electricity is cheap , and maybe even make some money by selling unused power back to the grid when it 's needed . Plug-in cars are on their way , with GM , Toyota and other manufacturers planning introductions in the next two years . At Google we have a small fleet of Toyota Prius and Ford Escape plug-in conversions , as a part of our RechargeIT program . The converted Prius plug-ins get over 90 MPG , and the Escapes close to 50 MPG . However to successfully put millions of plug-in cars on the road and and fuel them with green electricity , we need a smart grid that manages when we charge and how we 're billed . A smart grid could also provide for the two-way flow of electricity , as well as large-scale integration of intermittent solar and wind energy . Much of the technology in our current electrical grid was developed in the 60s and is wasteful and not very smart . We are partnering with GE to help accelerate the development of the smart grid and support building new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources . <p> We see a huge opportunity for the nation to confront our energy challenges .

To tackle this need , we 've been looking at investments in renewable energy projects , like the one we just signed , that can accelerate the deployment of the latest clean energy technology while providing attractive returns to Google and more capital for developers to build additional projects . <p> A clear windy day at the Ashtabula II wind farm <p> Were excited about this first project investment because it uses some of the latest wind turbine technology and control systems to provide one of the lowest-cost sources of renewable energy to the local grid . The turbines can continuously adjust the individual blade pitch angles to achieve optimal efficiency and use larger blades with 15 percent more swept area than earlier generations , allowing capture of even more wind energy for each turbine . The control systems for these wind farms are also advanced and dynamic , allowing for remote 24/7 monitoring and operation to ensure maximum turbine up-time and power production .

Water kiosks stand proudly along the main road . And yet , the taps run dry . The connections to the main line are not even functional . Young women still trudge the kilometers to the river , at risk to their own security , to collect water . Bright blue toilet stalls line the periphery of a girls school . While the school has seen an increase in attendance since the installation of these toilets , they continue to be plagued by their inability to deal with the sanitation requirements of their students .

They asked , " how come we did n't know about this earlier ? " <p> And yet , unsurprisingly , the people of Kisii have long known that they do n't have appropriate water and sanitation services . They may not have even heard of the MDG 's . They are likely unaware of the conversations that transpire amongst donors and development agencies and help shape where resources are allocated .

The Bali action plan provides a roadmap for negotiating an expanded and strengthened international emissions reduction pact by the end of 2009 . <p> The deal leaves many contentious issues unresolved . It does not include any explicit emissions reductions goals or targets ; in fact the scientific recommendations on the emissions reductions needed to halt climate change are relegated to a footnote . The plan simply lays out a process to negotiate the emissions targets to succeed the limits set by Kyoto Protocol , which expire in 2012 . It also provides a platform to begin talks to address growing concerns about adaption , deforestation and facilitating transfer of clean technologies to developing countries . <p> At the outset of this conference , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands collective action by the world 's governments . The Bali roadmap , while leaving much to be desired , represents an important step in this process . All the parties are still at the table and are now committed to spending the next two years crafting a more comprehensive global solution to fighting climate change . Many were hopeful that the outcome of the U.S. Presidential election in 2008 will help breathe new life into this process , regardless of whether the President-elect is a Republican or Democrat . <p> But given how difficult it was to reach an agreement in Bali and how acrimonious the negotiations were , the rest of us ca n't afford to wait for the world to negotiate a new climate agreement . We need to take action now . Fortunately , many people around the world are doing just that . The numerous panels and side events at Bali were filled with examples of concrete actions people are taking now to build a cleaner future . We wrote on how the world 's local governments are launching their own initiatives to fight global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions take into account equity and justice considerations . Another hot topic of conversation here was the growing efforts of many companies to reduce their carbon footprints and take a leadership role in promoting smart energy policies . <p> The flurry of activity among all of these groups is encouraging . The result at Bali and the tough road ahead suggests that the international treaty process will not be sufficient to confront this challenge with the speed and scope with which it demands , at least in the short term . To stop climate change , we all must take responsibility and act , whether by making choices to reduce our personal carbon footprint , engaging with family and friends in our communities , or elevating the climate crisis to the top of the political agenda . For the Google.org team , it means a renewed commitment to putting our own resources to work .
